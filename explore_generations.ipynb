      "PROMPT:\n",
      "  Write me a song called This Love (Taylor’s Version) with the following description: The “Taylor’s Version” of Swift’s 2014 song was released in May 2022 as part of the soundtrack on Prime Video’s TV series, The Summer I Turned Pretty. It followed the release of “Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version),” making it the second song on 1989 (Taylor’s Version) to see the light of day.\n",
      "This track finds Taylor using cyclical metaphors to ponder on the cycles of a relationship. Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s bad, but regardless, it’s still love. It also explores on the idea of fate — a quite common thread throughout Swift’s whole discography —: If a relationship is not supposed to happen at this point in time, you have to let the other person go, even if you don’t want to, and if it’s meant to be, they’ll eventually come back to your life.\n",
      "Following the release of 1989 in 2014, Swift told Yahoo! that she considers “This Love” to be the first song in which she really experimented with different vocal recording styles. She goes on to explore more of that side of music throughout 2017’s reputation.\n",
      "Additionally, as documented by a Tumblr user, this was the first song Swift have written to 1989, right after she dropped her 2012 album Red, and started out with the chorus as a short poem written in her book. Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.\n",

      "In this version of \"This Love,\" Taylor explores the idea of cycles in relationships, using cyclical metaphors to describe the ups and downs of love. She also touches on the theme of fate, suggesting that sometimes love is not meant to be, but holding on to the memories and hoping for a chance to come back together in the future. This song marks a departure from the original version, with a more experimental approach to vocal recording and a focus on the themes of love and fate that are prevalent throughout Taylor Swift's discography.\n"
