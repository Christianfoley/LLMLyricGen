       " 'Playboy: All right, let\\'s start with the most basic question there is: Are you a religious man? Do you believe in God?\\nSinatra: Well, that\\'ll do for openers. I think I can sum up my religious feelings in a couple of paragraphs. First: I believe in you and me. I\\'m like \\nAlbert Schweitzer\\n and \\nBertrand Russell\\n and \\nAlbert Einstein\\n in that I have a respect for life -- in any form. I believe in nature, in the birds, the sea, the sky, in everything I can see or that there is real evidence for. If these things are what you mean by God, then I believe in God. But I don\\'t believe in a personal God to whom I look for comfort or for a natural on the next roll of the dice. I\\'m not unmindful of man\\'s seeming need for faith; I\\'m for anything that gets you through the night, be it prayer, tranquilizers or a \\nbottle of Jack Daniel\\'s\\n. But to me religion is a deeply personal thing in which man and God go it alone together, without the witch doctor in the middle. The witch doctor tries to convince us that we have to ask God for help, to spell out to him what we need, even to bribe him with prayer or cash on the line. Well, I believe that God knows what each of us wants and needs. It\\'s not necessary for us to make it to church on Sunday to reach Him. You can find Him anyplace. And if that sounds heretical, my source is pretty good: Matthew, Five to Seven, The Sermon on the Mount.\\nPlayboy: You haven\\'t found any answers for yourself in organized religion?\\nSinatra: There are things about organized religion which I resent. Christ is revered as the Prince of Peace, but more blood has been shed in His name than any other figure in history. You show me one step forward in the name of religion and I\\'ll show you a hundred retrogressions. Remember, they were men of God who destroyed the educational treasures at Alexandria, who perpetrated the Inquisition in Spain, \\nwho burned the witches at Salem\\n. Over 25,000 organized religions flourish on this planet, but the followers of each think all the others are miserably misguided and probably evil as well. In India they worship white cows, monkeys and a dip in the Ganges. The Moslems accept slavery and prepare for Allah, who promises wine and revirginated women. And witch doctors aren\\'t just in Africa. If you look in the L.A. papers of a Sunday morning, you\\'ll see the local variety advertising their wares like suits with two pairs of pants.\\nPlayboy: Hasn\\'t religious faith just as often served as a civilizing influence?\\nSinatra: \\nRemember that leering, cursing lynch mob in Little Rock reviling a meek, innocent little 12-year-old Negro girl as she tried to enroll in public school?\\n  Weren\\'t they -- or most of them -- devout churchgoers? I detest the two-faced who pretend liberality but are practiced bigots in their own mean little spheres. \\nI didn\\'t tell my daughter whom to marry, but I\\'d have broken her back if she had had big eyes for a bigot.\\n As I see it, man is a product of his conditioning, and the social forces which mold his morality and conduct -- including racial prejudice -- are influenced more by material things like food and economic necessities than by the fear and awe and bigotry generated by the high priests of commercialized superstition. Now don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m for decency -- period. I\\'m for anything and everything that bodes love and consideration for my fellow man. But when lip service to some mysterious deity permits bestiality on Wednesday and absolution on Sunday -- cash me out.\\nPlayboy: But aren\\'t such spiritual hypocrites in a minority? Aren\\'t most Americans fairly consistent in their conduct within the precepts of religious doctrine?\\nSinatra: I\\'ve got no quarrel with men of decency at any level. But I can\\'t believe that decency stems only from religion. And I can\\'t help wondering how many public figures make avowals of religious faith to maintain an aura of respectability. Our civilization, such as it is, was shaped by religion, and the men who aspire to public office anyplace in the free world must make obeisance to God or risk immediate opprobrium. Our press accurately reflects the religious nature of our society, but you\\'ll notice that it also carries the articles and advertisements of astrology and hokey Elmer Gantry revivalists. We in America pride ourselves on freedom of the press, but every day I see, and so do you, this kind of dishonesty and distortion not only in this area but in reporting -- about guys like me, for instance, which is of minor importance except to me; but also in reporting world news. How can a free people make decisions without facts? If the press reports world news as they report about me, we\\'re in trouble.\\nPlayboy: Are you saying that . . .\\nSinatra: No, wait, let me finish. Have you thought of the chance I\\'m taking by speaking out this way? Can you imagine the deluge of crank letters, curses, threats and obscenities I\\'ll receive after these remarks gain general circulation? Worse, the boycott of my records, my films, maybe a picket line at my opening at the Sands. Why? Because I\\'ve dared to say that love and decency are not necessarily concomitants of religious fervor.\\nPlayboy: If you think you\\'re stepping over the line, offending your public or perhaps risking economic suicide, shall we cut this off now, erase the tape and start over along more antiseptic lines?\\nSinatra: No, let\\'s let it run. I\\'ve thought this way for years, ached to say these things. Whom have I harmed by what I\\'ve said? What moral defection have I suggested? No, I don\\'t want to chicken out now. Come on, pal, the clock\\'s running.\\nPlayboy: Hasn\\'t religious faith just as often served as a civilizing influence? Sinatra: Remember that leering, cursing lynch mob in Little Rock reviling a meek, innocent little 12-year-old Negro girl as she tried to enroll in public school? Weren\\'t they -- or most of them -- devout churchgoers? I detest the two-faced who pretend liberality but are practiced bigots in their own mean little spheres.

Come on, pal, the clock\\'s running.\\nPlayboy: All right, then, let\\'s move on to another delicate subject: disarmament. How do you feel about the necessity and possibility of achieving it?\\nSinatra: Well, that\\'s like apple pie and mother -- how can you be against it? After all, despite the universal and unanimous assumption that both powers -- Russia and the United States -- already have stockpiled more nuclear weaponry than is necessary to vaporize the entire planet, each power continues to build, improve and enlarge its terrifying arsenal. For the first time in history, man has developed the means with which to expunge all life in one shuddering instant. And, brother, no one gets a pass, no one hides from this one. But the question is not so much whether disarmament is desirable or even whether it can be achieved, but whether -- if we were able to achieve it -- we would be better off, or perhaps infinitely worse off.\\nPlayboy: Are you suggesting that disarmament might be detrimental to peace?\\nSinatra: Yes, in a certain very delicate sense. Look, I\\'m a realist, or at least I fancy myself one. Just as I believe that religion doesn\\'t always work, so do I feel that disarmament may be completely beyond man\\'s capacity to live with. Let\\'s forget for a moment the complex problems we might face in converting from a cold war to a peace economy. Let\\'s examine disarmament in terms of man\\'s political, social and philosophical conditioning. Let\\'s say that somehow the UN is able to achieve a disarmament program acceptable to all nations. Let\\'s imagine, a few years from now, total global disarmament. But imagine as well the gnawing doubts, suspicions and nerve-wracking tensions which must, inevitably, begin to fill the void: the fear that the other side -- or perhaps some third power -- is secretly arming or still holding a few bombs with which to surprise and overcome the other. But I firmly believe that nuclear war is absolutely impossible. I don\\'t think anyone in the world wants a nuclear war -- not even the Russians. They and we and the nth countries -- as nuclear strategists refer to future nuclear powers -- face the incontrovertible certainty of lethal retaliation for any nuclear strike. I can \\'t believe for a moment that the idiot exists in any nation that will push the first button -- not even accidentally.\\nPlayboy: You foresee no possibility of world war or of effective disarmament?\\nSinatra: I\\'m not an industrialist or an economist; I know I\\'m way out of my depth when I attempt even to comprehend the complexity of shifting the production of a country from war to peace. But if somehow all those involved in production of implements of destruction were willing to accept reason as well as reasonable profit, I think that a shift in psychology might be possible. And if this were to happen, I believe that the deep-seated terror in the hearts of most people due to the constant threat of total destruction would disappear. The result would be a more positive, less greedy, less selfish and more loving approach to survival. I can tell you this much from personal experience and observation: Hate solves no problems. It only creates them. But listen, you\\'ve been asking me a lot of questions, so let me ask you a question I posed to \\nMike Romanoff\\n the other night. You know, Mike is quite a serious thinker; when we spend an evening together, we play an intellectual chess game touching on all topics, including those we are discussing here. Anyway, I asked Mike what would happen if a summit meeting of all the leaders in every country in the world was called, including Red China, at the UN. Further suppose that each leader brings with him his top aides: Kennedy brings Rusk, Khrushchev brings Gromyko, Mao brings Chou. All these cats are together in one room, then -- boom! Somebody blows up the mother building. No more leaders. No more deputies. The question I asked Mike, and the one I ask you, is: What would happen to the world? Playboy: You tell us.\\nSinatra: I told Mike I thought it might be the only chance the world has for survival. But Mike just shook his head and said, \"Frank, you\\'re very sick.\" Maybe so. Until someone lights the fuse, however, I think that continuation of cold war preparedness might be more effective to maintain the peace than the dewy-eyed notion of total disarmament. I also wonder if \"total\" disarmament includes chemical and bacteriological weapons -- which, as you know, can be ju st as lethal as nuclear weapons. Card players have a saying: \"It\\'s all right to play if you keep your eyes on the deck\" -- which is another way of saying, \"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\"\\nPlayboy: Do you feel, then, that nuclear testing should be continued?\\nSinatra: Absolutely not. I think it\\'s got to stop, and I think it will stop -- because it has to stop. The name-calling in the UN and the finger-pointing at peace conferences is just a lot of diplomatic bull. Both sides have to live on this planet, and leaders in all countries know that their children and grandchildren have to live here, too. I suspect that when the limits of strontium 90 in the atmosphere get really dangerous, scientists in both camps will persuade the politicians to call a final halt to testing -- probably at precisely the same time, with no urging from the other side.\\nPlayboy: You spoke a moment ago of the fear and suspicion that might nullify any plan for lasting and effective disarmament. Isn\\'t continuing nuclear preparedness -- with or without further testing -- likely to engender these emotions on an even more dangerous scale?\\nSinatra: Fear is the enemy of logic. There is no more debilitating, crushing, self-defeating, sickening thing in the world -- to an individual or to a nation. If we continue to fear the Russians, and if they continue to fear us, then we\\'re both in big trouble. Neither side will be able to make logical, reasoned decisions. I think, however, that their fear and concern over the ideological balance of power in some areas is far from irrational. Our concern over a Sovietized Cuba 90 miles from Key West, for instance, must be equated with Russian concern over our missile bases surrounding them. It is proper that we should be deeply concerned, but we must be able to see their side of the coin -- and not let this concern turn into fear on either side.\\nPlayboy: On a practical level, how would you combat Communist expansion into areas such as Cuba, Laos and the emerging African nations?\\nSinatra: It strikes me as being so ridiculously simple: Stop worrying about communism; just get rid of the conditions that nurture it. Sidestepping Marxian philosophy and dialectical vagaries, I think that communism can fester only wherever and whenever it is encouraged to breed -- not just by the Communists themselves, but by depressed social and economic conditions: and we can always count on the Communists to exploit those conditions. Poverty is probably the greatest asset the Communists have. Wherever it exists, anyplace in the world, you have a potential Communist breeding ground. It figures that if a man is frustrated in a material sense, his family hungry, he suffers, he broods and he becomes susceptible to the blandishments of any ideology that promises to take him off the hook.\\nPlayboy: Do you share with the American Right Wing an equal concern about the susceptibility of our own country to Communist designs?\\nSinatra: Well, if you\\'re talking about that poor, beaten, dehumanized, discriminated-against guy in some blighted Tobacco Road down in the South, he\\'s certainly in the market for offers of self-improvement. But you can\\'t make me believe that a machinist in Detroit, ending a 40-hour week, climbing into his \\'63 Chevy, driving to a steak barbecue behind his $25,000 home in a tree-lined subdivision, about to begin a weekend with his well-fed, well-clothed family, is going to trade what he\\'s got for a Party card. In America -- except for tiny pockets of privation which still persist -- Khrushchev has as much chance of succeeding as he has of making 100 straight passes at the crap table.\\nPlayboy: In combating Communist expansion into underdeveloped areas here and abroad, what can we do except to offer massive material aid and guidance of the kind we\\'ve been providing since the end of World War II?\\nSinatra: I don\\'t know. I\\'m no economist. I don\\'t pretend to have much background in political science. But this much I know: Attending rallies sponsored by 110-percent anti-Communist cultists or donning white sheets and riding with the Klan -- \\nthe one that\\'s spelled with a \"K\"\\n -- isn\\'t the answer. All I know is that a nation with our standard of living, with our Social Security system, TVA, farm parity, health plans and unemployment insurance can afford to address itself to the cancers of starvation, substandard housing, educational voids and second-class citizenship that still exist in many backsliding areas of our own country. When we\\'ve cleaned up these blemishes, then we can go out with a clean conscience to see where else in the world we can help. Hunger is inexcusable in a world where grain rots in silos and butter turns rancid while being held for favorable commodity indices.\\nPlayboy: Is American support of the UN one of the ways in which we can uplift global economic conditions? Sinatra: It seems to me that a lot of us consider the UN a private club -- ours, of course -- with gentlemen\\'s agreements just like any other exclusive club. Only instead of excluding a person, a race or a religion, the members of the UN have the power to exclude entire nations. I don\\'t happen to think you can kick 800,000,000 Chinese under the rug and simply pretend that they don\\'t exist. Because they do. If the UN is to be truly representative, then it must accept all the nations of the world. If it doesn\\'t represent the united nations of the world, then what the hell have you got? Not democracy -- and certainly not world government. Everybody seems to have forgotten that President Kennedy, before he became President, in his book, Strategy of Peace, plainly advocated recognition of Red China. So I\\'m not too far out on the limb, am I?\\nPlayboy: With or without mainland China in the UN, what do you feel are the prospects for an eventual American rapprochement with Russia?\\nSinatra: I\\'m a singer, not a prophet or a diplomat. Ask the experts or read the Rockefeller brothers\\' reports. But speaking just as a layman, an ordinary guy who thinks and worries, I think that if we can stay out of war for the next 10 years, we\\'ll never have another war. From all I\\'ve read and seen recently, I\\'m betting that within the next decade the Russians will be on the credit- card kick just as we are. They\\'re going to want color TV, their wives are going to want electrified kitchens, their kids are going to want hot rods. Even Russian girls are getting hip; I\\'ve seen photos of them at Russian beach resorts, and it looks just like the Riviera. They\\'re thinning down, and I see they\\'re going the bikini route. When GUM department store in Moscow starts selling bikinis, we\\'ve got a fighting chance, because that means the girls are interested in being girls and the boys are going to stop thinking about communes and begin thinking connubially. I\\'ve always had a theory that whenever guys and gals start swinging, they begin to lose interest in conquering the world. They just want a comfortable pad and stereo and wheels, and their thoughts turn to the good things of life -- not to war. They loosen up, they live and they\\'re more apt to let live. Dig?\\nPlayboy: We dig.\\nSinatra: You know, I\\'d love to visit Russia, and sometime later, China, too. I figure the more I know about them and the more they know about me, the better chance we have of living in the same world in peace. I don\\'t intend to go there with a mission, to sell the American way of life: I\\'m not equipped to get into that kind of discussion about government. But I\\'d love to go and show them American music. I\\'d take Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald with me and we\\'d do what we do best. We\\'d wail up a storm with real American jazz so that their kids could see what kind of music our kids go for, because I\\'m sure that kids are the same all over the world. I\\'m betting that they\\'d dig us. And that\\'s got to create some kind of good will, and man, a little good will is something we could use right now. All it takes is good will and a smile to breach that language barrier. When the Moiseyev Dancers were in Los Angeles. Eddie and Liz Fisher gave a party for them, and although I couldn\\'t speak a word of Russian, I got along fine. I just said, \"Hello, baby\" to the dancers and they shouted, \"Allo, babee\" back at me. We had a ball.\\nPlayboy: Frank, you\\'ve expressed some negative views on human nature in the course of this conversation. Yet one gets the impression that -- despite the bigotry, hypocrisy, stupidity, cruelty and fear you\\'ve talked about -- you feel there are still some grounds for hope about the destiny of homo sapiens. Is that right?\\nSinatra: Absolutely. I\\'m never cynical, never without optimism about the future. The history of mankind proves that at some point the people have their innings, and I think we\\'re about to come up to bat now. I think we can make it if we live and let live. And love one another -- I mean really love. If you don\\'t know the guy on the other side of the world, love him anyway because he\\'s just like you. He has the same dreams, the same hopes and fears. It\\'s one world, pal. We\\'re all neighbors. But didn\\'t somebody once go up onto a mountain long ago and say the same thing to the world?',\n",

I mean it's like a compliment kind of.\\nKanye:\\n What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.\\nTaylor:\\n That's sweet.\\nKanye:\\n I want things that make you feel good. I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.\\nTaylor:\\n Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way.\\nTaylor:\\n And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice!\\nKanye:\\n Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.\\nTaylor:\\n Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!\\nTaylor:\\n …things without like even asking or seeing if I'd be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.\\nTaylor:\\n I'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.\\nTaylor:\\n And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and it's the most Instagram likes I've ever gotten.\\nKanye:\\n \\nRelationships are more important than punchlines, you know.\\nTaylor:\\n Yea. I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, that's a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…\\nTaylor:\\n You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didn't know who I was before that.\\nTaylor:\\n It doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that.\\nTaylor:\\n … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, I'm always gonna respect you.\\nTaylor:\\n And I'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.\\nKanye:\\n Thank you too.\\nTaylor:\\n And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.\\nTaylor:\\n You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.\\nTaylor:\\n …awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! It's more provocative to say, Might still have sex.\\nTaylor:\\n …it's not. \\nIt doesn't matter to me. There's not one that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't.\\n2020 Leak\\nKanye:\\n —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.\\nTaylor:\\n What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.\\nKanye:\\n The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.\\nTaylor:\\n What does it say? [nervous laughter]\\nKanye:\\n It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?\\nTaylor:\\n Yeah…\\nKanye:\\n Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.\\nTaylor:\\n Well, is it gonna be mean?\\nKanye:\\n No, I don’t think it’s mean.\\nTaylor:\\n Okay, then let me hear it.\\nKanye:\\n Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?\\nTaylor:\\n Okay.\\nKanye:\\n \\nSo it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” [chuckles]\\nTaylor:\\n [chuckles] That’s not mean.\\nKanye:\\n Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”\\nTaylor:\\n Oh my [laughs]. I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. \\nI thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not.\\n Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.\\nKanye:\\n Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.\\nTaylor:\\n You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?\\nKanye:\\n Yeah.\\nTaylor:\\n \\nI try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.\\nKanye:\\n Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.\\nTaylor:\\n I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of [laughs].\\nKanye:\\n I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. \\nShe was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”\\nTaylor:\\n That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…\\nKanye:\\n \\nYeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—\\nTaylor:\\n That’s sweet.\\nKanye:\\n —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He’s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.”\\nTaylor:\\n Why are people saying you’re bullying Nike?\\nKanye:\\n Because on “Facts” I said like, “Yeezy, Nike out here bad, they can’t give shit away.”\\nTaylor:\\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that’s just what you do though.\\nKanye:\\n [laughs]\\nTaylor:\\n [laughs] I mean, I wouldn’t say that it’s like possible to bully a company like Nike where—I mean, um, yeah, I mean …\",\n",

       " 'Pop music (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of \"popular\") is usually understood to be commercially recorded music, often oriented towards a youth market, usually consisting of relatively short, simple songs utilizing technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. Pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, but as a genre is particularly associated with the rock and roll and later rock style.The phrase “pop music” was first coined around the middle of the 1920′s, it meant a piece of music had “popular” appeal. Numerous things that took place during the recordings of the 20′s could be seen as being the start of the modern day pop music industry, which includes rhythm and blues music, as well as, country, folk, and others.\\nPop music has been a profitable industry in America since the 19th century, but Early Pop/Rock is a style that took shape in the post-rock & roll era, once the more conservative elements of the record industry had come to terms with the new musical landscape. Popular culture is distributed across many forms of mass communication including newspapers, magazines, radio, television, movies, music, books and cheap novels, comics and cartoons, and advertising. It contrasts with high cultural art forms, such as opera, classical music and artworks, traditional theater and literature. In mass communication, the term popular culture refers to messages that make limited intellectual and aesthetic demands through content that is designed to amuse and entertain audiences.\\nMichael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, the seventh of Katherine and Joe Jackson’s nine children. At the age of 5, Jackson began performing with his older brothers in a music group coached by their steelworker father. In 1968, Motown Records signed the group, which became known as the Jackson 5, and Michael Jackson, a natural showman, emerged as the lead singer and star. The Jackson 5’s first album, released in 1969, featured the hit \"I Want You Back,\" and the group’s brand of pop-soul-RnB music made them an immediate success. Their musical popularity even led to their starring in their own TV cartoon series in the early 1970s. Jackson released his first solo album, \"Got to Be There,\" in 1972, while continuing to sing with his brothers. Six years later, in 1978, he made his big-screen debut as the Scarecrow in \"The Wiz,\" an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name. Directed by Quincy Jones, the film starred an all-black cast that included singer Diana Ross as Dorothy. Jones collaborated with Jackson on his 1979 album “Off the Wall,” which sold some 7 million copies worldwide. The pair teamed up again for Jackson’s now-iconic 1982 album, \"Thriller,\" which went on to sell 50 million copies around the globe, making it the best-selling studio album of all time. \"Thriller\" is credited with jump-starting the era of music videos and playing a key role in the rise of then-fledging cable TV network MTV, which launched in 1981.  With his record-breaking album Thriller and such international hit singles as “Billie Jean” and “Beat It,” Michael Jackson became the quintessential ’80s pop star. Jackson’s ability to blend r&b with pop, rock guitars with dance beats, combined with his cross-format radio success and innovative videos to create a pop music template that is still with us today.',\n",

       " 'Zane Lowe\\n: Nice to see you again man. Thanks for stopping by the BBC for a chat\\nKanye West\\n:  Good to see you too sir. Thank you\\nZane Lowe\\n: So, I was thinking today like where do we begin? \\nBecause you’ve been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time.\\n We were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. The first question I wanted to ask you, cause I’ve always wondered how you felt at that time\\nKanye West\\n:  I had so many interviews where I’m trying to express that I can create, that I can create outside of just the music box \\nand I’m giving examples of work that I did that was really successful and I’m getting just completely shut down.\\n \\nBut not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like “no, you are celebrity.\\n You are not allowed to create, you’re not allowed to think, you’re not allowed to have an opinion. \\nYou’re just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.”\\n \\nAnd it’s true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as I told you last time I said I’m a product guy\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and I mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what’s occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. You know, what’s happened recently with Yeezy supply, you know your deal with Adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they’ve seen -- how has that experience been for you? How can you put that into context for us?\\nKanye West\\n:  I mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it’s a challenge. You gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. So that’s the way I’mma word it. You know what I’m saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was flexible enough \\nand had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart.\\n You know, they original hip hop\\nZane Lowe\\n: Of course, Run DMC man I mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and I wondered when did the conversation actually begin with Adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry?\\nKanye West\\n:  That conversation had already started before then. There was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling \\nJon Wexler\\n you know, it was a certain point where I just felt like I couldn’t breathe anymore like I had all these ideas and I felt like I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone’s creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something. And anyone that’s creative understands that there’s no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create. There’s no check out and there’s no cheque to stop you from creative. No pun intended when I’m saying no check\\nZane Lowe\\n: Was a good one though\\nKanye West\\n:  Just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because I mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. I mean I look at over 500 images a day on my laptop. \\nAnd I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I said “people be dissing me on Hypebeast”\\n and it’s like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a long time, \\nsince like Universe City.\\n Like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. I’mma throw this one out here. I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was working on \\nYeezus\\n \\nand I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.\\n And the guy, actually I forgot about the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C. and I was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and I’m sitting with him, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket. And he makes some joke about, you know “You did look pretty hot. I’m happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.”\\nZane Lowe\\n: Was he joking do you think?\\nKanye West\\n:  He was leveling. He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time. Like if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet. You know someone that I know that’s put in a lot of work. And it’s a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. You know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. And I’m just sitting like “Whoa, ok.” Obviously I have to show him like hey I’m working on this stuff and it’s coming out good and this is all I have a chance to work on. \\nYou know like when I worked with A.P.C. I only had two times to look at the collection, you know I couldn’t really grab it and dig into it the way I dig into like working on “All Of The Lights” or something like that, it’s like, there’s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you’re dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently\\nZane Lowe\\n: I can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you’re leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. Seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. At those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled Kanye West\\n: Everyone, everyone I talked to would try to level me. You know. And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of Adidas. And I say “was” because he passed away recently. \\nAnd I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we’ve never shown online because you have to experience it in it’s space.\\n It’s the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. And which I got all no’s on that – to date. And this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed. He believed that maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was. In me he could tell, he knew, he’s like this guy has something to say and to give that’s past the current box that he’s put in. \\nAnd he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.\\n And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. \\nThe deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.\\n That is what the deal is about. \\nThe deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there’s never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show.\\n \\nThe deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater,\\n and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard “Wolves,\" when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasn\\'t about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people.\\n I feel like there\\'s so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it.\\n And I asked my assistant one time. I was like, \"how does these clothes make you feel?\" She said, \"I feel powerful.\" And that\\'s our, that\\'s our main goal. \\nAs the song says, \"no one man should have all that power.\" No \\none\\n man should have it. Everyone should have it\\nZane Lowe\\n: You seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that.. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way you\\'re able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. And it feels like you\\'re very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. You know, and across the border. And when that moment kind of occurred to you. Cause that doesn\\'t happen overnight, you know.. there\\'s.. but it does lead up to that. And 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. And now it seems to me like you\\'re very consciously aware\\nKanye West\\n: Yeah, I was still off, you know what I mean? I might have some things that are off now, but I feel like, in the same way when I came up with \"All Falls Down,\" and I was able to differentiate myself from whoever I was trying to rap like at that point and I found my voice and my message. It\\'s like, I felt like..\\nZane Lowe\\n: That was the moment you felt like that was, yeah..\\nKanye West\\n: \\nWhen I wrote \"All Falls Down.\" That\\'s when I was like, \"okay, this is who I am in the.. this is what I\\'m, this is what I\\'m presenting.\"\\n So now I feel like.. it\\'s funny, I would always say, you know, \\n\"I wanna sculpt with marble.\"\\n And it wasn\\'t until I was working on \\nYeezus\\n, and I was learning about furniture and the fact that I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for. \\nAnd one of the things they had was  this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone. And it was made of cement. So it wasn\\'t the material, it was the idea that was the most important.\\n And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn\\'t until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use. That I find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. You know, it was a futile argument for me to say, \"hey, everyone, get behind me so I can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford.\" It\\'s like insane. \\nBut now I feel people rallying because they know that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I know that Adidas can eventually get those price points.\\n \\nAnd I want to apologize to everyone right now because I believe that Season 1 may still be in that upper price point\\n and there\\'s still the words \"exclusivity,\" you know, being thrown around. \"Exclusivity\" is the new N-word. Not nigga, \"exclusivity.\" Am I saying the word right?\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yeah\\nKanye West\\n: Yeah, \\nthat\\n is the new N-word. Cause nothing should be exclusive.  \\nEveryone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain.\\n The idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. And saying, \"we\\'re gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain.\" \\nYou know, we have to reboot our mentality. Period. Of a generation. You know, it wouldn\\'t even matter if I sold one sweatshirt. You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. And they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. You know\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yeah. Because the thing is when people hear you talking at times I think that there\\'s a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, you\\'re compelling to a lot of people. And, you know, what you say is.. I think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. But some people I think have thought overtime  that.. they\\'ve obviously missed the point. They\\'ve thought that you bringing it back to you. But you\\'re actually trying to open up to everybody else. You\\'re trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know.. If you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. It might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point\\nKanye West\\n: And I was, I was using the wrong words. My rap was wrong. You know what I\\'m saying? I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. You know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar. \"Yo, what up, baby? I\\'m a genius!\" They be like, \"yo, who\\'s this guy?\" \"No, I\\'m telling you, I sold all this, I sold this many shoes.\" Then she be like, \"yo, chill, chill.\" Like, \"gosh, get me out of here already.\" You know what I\\'m saying? And that\\'s who I was and that was that frustration I had cause I\\'m seeing like this.. I\\'m looking at this girl like, \"man, I know that..\"\\nZane Lowe\\n: \"We could be good together, this could work.\"\\nKanye West\\n: Yeah, I know, I just don\\'t know how to work it\\nZane Lowe\\n: So I\\'m messing it up, yeah\\nKanye West\\n: \\nAnd the right way so I\\'m gonna stumble. I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know.. Zane Lowe\\n: You\\'re the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations?\\nKanye West\\n: Yeah. I did not know how to communicate at all. And it\\'s like I had my point, my message was, you know, simply like, \\n\"your egg, my semen, we change the world.\"\\n You know, and I imagine that that\\'s gonna sound wrong\\nZane Lowe\\n: That\\'s a hell of a pick up line, man\\nKanye West\\n: I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like..\\nZane Lowe\\n: It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, wrong..\\nKanye West\\n: We have the right to be wrong sometimes\\nZane Lowe\\n: That\\'s a great line. You know I wanted to talk to you.. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, I mean, we talked a couple times before as well. And you know I\\'m a music guy, I mean, it really drives me, and it\\'s a big part of my life. And over the course of this conversation, you know, I wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause I\\'m fascinated in the certain things I wanna touch on, but I do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if that\\'s cool. Do you want to talk about music?\\nKanye West\\n: Yeah\\nZane Lowe\\n: Cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn\\'t \\nreally\\n wanna talk about \\nYezus\\n. You were like, \"that\\'s cool and everything, but I wanna talk about this.\" And lately, I just, maybe I\\'m, I feel like you\\'re really energized with music in a big way\\nKanye West\\n: You know, after I did the presentation in New York I \\nwas able to get that alien out of my stomach,\\n you know like. I was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the \"Blessings\" video with Big Sean and Drake\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yeah\\nKanye West\\n: And I couldn\\'t have been happier. To go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. Well, let\\'s be respectful and truthful. \\nThe\\n hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. And I fall somewhere in that, you know? In that, that field. So..\\nZane Lowe\\n: Getting back to music for a minute, I feel like we\\'re right back, I gotta bring you right back for a second. I want to know what we can look forward to on this record. \\nYou talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents.\\n And every record you have made has been something new and fresh. You\\'ve taken yourself and your craft to a new place. Where\\'s your head at right now with this new album? Kanye West\\n: Just working hard. On it\\nZane Lowe\\n: And it\\'s fun?\\nKanye West\\n: And it\\'s fun. And it\\'s fun to work hard and we\\'re being inventive and I\\'ve still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people. That fight, and you know, \\nThe College Dropout\\n came out of a fight to want to rap. And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design. \\nAnd..\\nZane Lowe\\n: I wondered about that, cause \\nYeezus\\n was punk-rock to me. That was like, that was Sex Pistols to me. That was like Public Enemy to me. That was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. And I wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. And without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. Where it\\'s coming from\\nKanye West\\n: I mean, it\\'s a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know\\nZane Lowe\\n: As opposed to just the struggle?\\nKanye West\\n: Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible.\\n You know I wanna perform “Only One” \\nas\\n many times as possible. You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I didn’t come here to be liked I came here to make a difference. I’m not talking about this interview, I’m talking about life. Some people’s job they’re very extremely likeable and I think I could figure that out. I think I’m way nicer to people just in general. Everyone I meet I’m extremely nice. But as soon as people start playing games I stop. I stop playing games. And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one. People be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. But it’s all love, and great energy and positive energy. I like the, I like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I’m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like “da-da-da-da-da!” and this happened and that happened and he say “Yo man, it’s all cool though! How bout we make a song?” And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song\\nZane Lowe\\n: He is the most, cause I’ve met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. And he so gets it in the sense that it’s like kinda let it lead you. Let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe I get from him like yea, let’s just see where this goes\\nKanye West\\n: And yea that’s what we did. You know people think that our first two singles don’t have drums but both of those are percussive instruments\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yea totally that’s what he’s doing. That’s like “dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun” that’s what it is. S I just wanna talk about working with him because I haven’t actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe I’m wrong, but I just, I love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it’s a natural one. Certainly on “FourFiveSeconds” I think that’s one of\\n Rihanna’s greatest vocal performances period\\nKanye West\\n: She was killing that right?\\nZane Lowe\\n: My gosh man. I mean that’s like a whole other attitude that I haven’t heard from her as a star. She’s really gone inside that record and wrangled it. How was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to, \\nit almost has like a 70’s FM American rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what I mean, like something you would’ve heard in Los Angeles in ’76 or something\\nKanye West\\n: I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was growing up. And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don’t need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that..\\nZane Lowe\\n: It’s because he invented them\\nKanye West\\n: Yea exactly. And be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it’s just like way next to, \\nlike meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yea, totally!\\nKanye West\\n: It’s like “whoa!”\\nZane Lowe\\n: Dude he’s the greatest\\nKanye West\\n: The greatest of their field, period. Of all time\\nZane Lowe\\n: And you got to say “wildin’” in a song with him it’s just incredible cause it’s still hip hop, that’s what’s amazing about it\\nKanye West\\n: Yea the whole cadence was trap. Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trap\\nZane Lowe\\n: That’s again is the fusion of cultures which I love. It’s what did you call it before when you when you were talking about Sean wearing [Raf?] and your shoes – you were saying, it’s -- I can’t remember what you said\\nKanye West\\n: \\nFusion is the future. Period. The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know.\\n Humanity period man, we’re one people and maybe that’s like \\nincorrect English – I’m sorry mom\\n – but you know I went to Louise Wilson’s memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. And I’m talking about \\nof all timers\\n.\\nZane Lowe\\n: Educate us man, tell us\\nKanye West\\n: \\nOk so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever. \\nNotorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. So the first time that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo\\'s \\nCéline\\n collection, I was looking at a 12. When I saw McQueen’s last show the \\nAtlantis\\n collection, I was looking at a 12. Christopher Kane\\'s \\nBandage\\n collection I’m looking at a 12. Alber Elbaz I’m looking at a 12. That’s the designer, the designer of\\n Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men’s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.\\n Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. And she said so many students, they don’t give it their all. And the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap\\nZane Lowe\\n: \\n(clapping)\\nKanye West\\n: \\nExactly, that’s what she said, they clap. And she just looked at me, she said “Kanye, don’t clap.”\\nZane Lowe\\n: Aww, what, that’s just! How you getting on with that?\\nKanye West\\n: \\nI didn’t know we were gonna lose her.\\n You know I just um, and she told me she said, you know “thank you for the times you know, when we came to performances” and “this has like really meant a lot to me.” You know she would—\\nZane Lowe\\n Wanna take a minute? We’ll take a minute. Let’s take a minute\\nKanye West\\n: That’s never happened to me in an interview before\\nZane Lowe\\n: You ok?\\nKanye West\\n: Yea, I’m ok, I think I’m ok\\nZane Lowe\\n: We’re gonna change the subject. Here we go. One of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you’re gonna be the head of the world’s first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind Kanye was what is that company going to look like?\\nKanye West\\n: Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion from what I know, Elon Musk included, is like the world’s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design. And I said from what I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot that are great but Johnny Ive\\'s the best that I know. He said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I think that, I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a way. So, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn’t be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me driving down the westside highway “there’s no money in the innovation.”\\nZane Lowe\\n: Yea, and he’s got a point\\nKanye West\\n: The money’s in the repetition, you know so..\\nZane Lowe\\n: It’s in the quality\\nKanye West\\n: And making something of better quality for more people. So it has to be a balance of both. I’ve said this a few times but I wanna just say it right here for people who haven’t read it or seen but I think people think that I pander to fashion particularly. You know because, people say “why fashion?” It’s not politics, world war it’s not that, it’s fashion, it’s \\njust\\n a jacket or something, it’s \\njust\\n a dress. But I believe that the world can only be saved through design. And I think that the fashion world has.. and when I say through design, I know it’s some snarky classist editor that’s gonna take that and say “Kanye West said that the world will be saved with a couture dress.” That’s not what I’m saying. The mentality behind design, you know art is to be free. Design is to fix\\nZane Lowe\\n: This is important, you’re talking about the actual, like you say the mentality, the purpose behind it, what it means behind the actual product\\nKanye West\\n: No politics, just truth. Does it fucking work or not. Irrigation, you know, that’s a form of design\\nZane Lowe\\n: What are those conversations like, because you, one of the great privileges that you’re in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves. So that conversations can be pushed. And I wonder what those conversations are like because I’m fascinated by somebody like Elon Musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary. And you are very much cut from that same cloth. What is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or [?] as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that?\\nKanye West\\n: That’s exactly what we talk about. What does Kanye West and Elon Musk talk about? The fut’\\nZane Lowe\\n: The fut’ -- TM\\nKanye West\\n: So when I put out things that if I say hey, I want to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just put it out, you know. We just put it out there. Or as I told Obama last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest that you sit with Elon Musk. I would suggest that both you guys go to China. I would suggest this. The, I think it may happen\\nZane Lowe\\n: Must be amazing, those conversations man must be amazing\\nKanye West\\n: I got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it. And I almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I wasn’t going crazy, I was like the only person that \\nwasn’t \\ncrazy. You know what I’m saying like, I just stand there and I just look like “is anyone else here seeing what I’m seeing? None of you guys are seeing what I’m seeing” or it’s just like your Maybach and your house is like \\nthat\\n important that you won’t move at all\\nZane Lowe\\n: It’s distractions\\nKanye West\\n: That you won’t say anything at all in risk of losing something. You won’t say anything on anyone’s behalf at this point? You know so, if you have that ability to do that, to see that, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to apply it. You have to use it. You can’t be psyched out. You know, everyone’s on our side. I was just in my own way, but everyone’s on our side and everything that I ever said will happen, will happen. Just as much as you guys saw that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you saw that front row. The juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future. It is the glass shattering of the class system, which is the new racism. Class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement. To somehow say that this person right here means more than this person. Like I know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but \\nall\\n lives matter. Like, my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. He keeps us safe. My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work every day. The guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne. It’s no more of this separation of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty. Whatever it is that people use to separate people\\nZane Lowe\\n: But was that moment, which I didn’t want to talk about but you raised it and I want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience. You can’t have all those answers straight away, you have to make those mistakes yourself I think in order to come to that level of clarity\\nKanye West\\n: And I’m not saying I have answers, I’m just saying these are my current opinions. As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions now\\nZane Lowe\\n: Sure, sure, and that’s great, that’s what we want, that’s why I’m asking questions so we get to hear your answers. \\nBut when you, I think…\\n \\nCause you know I was nominated for that Album Of The Year as well as part of the Sam Smith album as a producer and a co-writer\\nKanye West\\n: Oh, oh wow\\nZane Lowe\\n: Right, so I was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co-writers that are part of each records. And, like I’m a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and I’m a huge fan of Beck and it’s funny that you say, you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion. But then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old Ye, you know old Yeezy. Is that what happened that night? Just “gaaah, I can’t take it I’ve gotta get up on this stage, I’ve gotta wild out.” Cause we all thought you were joking. You know what I thought was brilliant about that night? When you did it on the night, I was applauding because I was like, \\n“that was Sun Tzu, that was Art of War.”\\n He waited for the right platform, went up, pretended to do it, walked back down everyone’s like “aww, so funny” I was like “he just got the last laugh on this.” And then I woke up the next morning and it was like “naw, he’s not an artist” and I was like “aw man, I \\nlove\\n that album!”\\nKanye West\\n: Yea, I never said that he’s not an artist\\nZane Lowe\\n: Ok, I’m misquoting you. But you were talking about artistry. And do you learn form those lessons yourself? Is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important? When you do things like and think, well maybe I did kinda misconstrue that\\nKanye West\\n: I think yea I misconstrued it but I think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong. \\nYou know, there could be a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball. But there’s a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn’t get the ball.\\n And everyone has a right to their opinion. You know, and I expressed my opinion, and I’ll take the weight of it\\nZane Lowe\\n: He’s great though. You know, he is great though. There’s three..\\nKanye West\\n: Naw you know as I said on the Charlamagne interview when I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I was like “this is really good… maybe I might’ve been wrong!” You know like, and uh..\\nZane Lowe\\n: It’s a great album man\\nKanye West\\n: And I hadn’t been in like 6 years. And the Grammy’s are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. Soon as you get in a car with them, you wanna go right back home\\nZane Lowe\\n: So we’re gonna get a record this year, and I’m excited to hear it, I really am excited to hear it, and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk I want to do it once again bring it back to like, the thing that really --\\nKanye West\\n: only one thing I want to say, people say I’m a hypocrite right?\\nZane Lowe\\n: Some\\nKanye West\\n: People say that right?\\nZane Lowe\\n: Some\\nKanye West\\n: Yes, I am. 100%. I’m a human being. I’m super hypocritical. I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time. I do it in the design office. I do it in the studio. I’m super hypo- I really love this, I do it when I get dressed. “I love this” \\n(tsk, tsk)\\n “I \\nhate\\n this!”\\nZane Lowe\\n: How long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis?\\nKanye West\\n: 3 minutes. 2 minutes. Bars\\nZane Lowe\\n: How long does it take your wife to get dressed every day?\\nKanye West\\n: Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes longer. I mean she’s a woman\\nZane Lowe\\n: Course. You know it seems that um, you know what I love about “Only One” is the interaction and the way that you’ve been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another, through one another, as a portal. And I love that. And I think it’s one of those songs that successfully does that. And um, I’m a father, you’re a father, it’s the greatest thing of all time. No question about it, it is the great level of all time, it’s the greatest thing of all time. And, you know your daughter is what, 18 months now? 18 months old? You an only child?\\nKanye West\\n: Yes\\nZane Lowe\\n: Do you think about giving her brothers and sisters? Do you think about your upbringing and what you went through and how you feel in this life and what it means to have siblings?\\nKanye West\\n: Oh, I’m practicing really hard. I try as many times a day as I can. Nori this one is for you! You need a sibling!\\nZane Lowe\\n: For all the good ones, and all the ones where everyone’s like totally engaged with everything you’re saying, for right or for wrong or whatever, I think you’ve got it totally sussed. I think you know you absolutely know that you’ve talked recently about being the villain, like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing. But then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are, 100%. And it’s so funny it goes from like “Boooo!” to like “Yeaaaa!” to like “Boooo!” to like “Yeaaaa!” and it’s like, I think you’ve got it sussed, I think you know what’s going on all the time with all of this\\nKanye West\\n: You win some games and you lose some\\nZane Lowe\\n: You win or you learn right?\\nKanye West\\n: Yea, you win or you \\nlearn\\n. Bam, there’s a jewel, I’ll take that one with me\\nZane Lowe\\n: Right on, quote book. So album this year, sneak attack, no doubt, no question, sneak attack’s coming and um, and there was a leaked poster that came out as well, you gonna tour with Rihanna? Is that out there now? Has that been confirmed or not confirmed, or what the story with that it?\\nKanye West\\n: I don’t believe I’m supposed to confirm or not confirm\\nZane Lowe\\n: So that’s happening. I’ve been long enough in the tooth to know what that means! Um, but needless to say you’re excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we’re looking forward to new music this year\\nKanye West\\n: Yea, and I been doing a few performances since doing the SNL performance, did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the Brits. I’ve been really liking these performances. I feel like these are like the performance version of that you know Drake, you know of the 6 God album, of the you know \\nIf you’re Reading This It’s Too Late\\n. I feel like I’m a visual extension of what he’s doing like sonically\\nZane Lowe\\n: Can we talk about Drake for a second cause he’s just to me he’s the monster at the moment out there\\nKanye West\\n: You know… that shit is good yo!\\nZane Lowe\\n: Dude, “6PM in New York” – that moment when he’s like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he’s just basically just opening up what’s going on is my real honesty, not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything. Just like you know, “they scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments” like \\npffff\\n I mean that moment for me is just like, that’s what, I mean I love that about him that he’s totally open in the sense\\nKanye West\\n: I mean yea, that element is great. There’s a lot of people that can’t rap that can do that. But the main thing is that fact that he’s delivering you know a level of product – as I said last interview, I’m a product guy – and he’s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality. It works. 80% of the time works all the time!\\nZane Lowe\\n: That doesn’t make sense!\\nKanye West\\n: Haha, but it works. It works. You know what I’m saying. And you have to.. it works. That’s it. And I was just thinking like, I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I can say is run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don’t stop. And you know any time I can be of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know whatever you need. You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company, I’m not supposed to say that! You know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team. You know, not just me and him. Us all\\nZane Lowe\\n: Thanks man. I always love talking with you bro, I really do. Alright we’re good\\nKanye West\\n: Got some vibes? Bars?\\nZane Lowe\\n: Bars!\\nKanye West\\n: More bars!',\n",

One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...\\n \\nSo, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other',\n",

I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.\\nWe were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.\\nAnd I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. \\nAnd just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great.\\n In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.\\nIt reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done.\\n But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.\",\n",

       " 'My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character\\'s does. \\nIt’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.\\nI\\'m highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. \\nTo this day, when I hear \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I\\'m clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house.\\n \\nWhen I hear \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\" by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics.\\n When I hear \"How to Save a Life\" by The Fray, \"Breathe (2AM)\" by Anna Nalick, or \"The Story\" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I\\'d get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the \\nGrey\\'s Anatomy\\n soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I\\'m convinced that \"You Learn\" by Alanis Morissette, \"Put Your Records On\" by Corinne Bailey Rae and \"Why\" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.\\nI love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I\\'m writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.\\nThe fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You\\'d think that as pop writers, we\\'re supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you\\'d assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… \\nAND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See \"Love Story,\" 2009).\\nIn modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like \"Kiki, do you love me\" and \"Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover\" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level.\\n \\nThis year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.\\nI think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, \"this is what I went through\" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It\\'s this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book.',\n",
