Like you honestly didn't know who I was before that.\nTaylor:\n It doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that.\nTaylor:\n \u2026 that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts.

It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.\nKanye:\n Thank you too.\nTaylor:\n And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.\nTaylor:\n You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.\nTaylor:\n \u2026awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous!

I wanted you to put the song out.\nTaylor:\n What would people \u2026 I guess it would just be, people would be like, \u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d And I had something to do with it, probably.\nKanye:\n The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.\nTaylor:\n What does it say? [nervous laughter]\nKanye:\n It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I\u2019ve thought about this line for eight months, I\u2019ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it\u2019s the most controversial, so it\u2019s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?\nTaylor:\n Yeah\u2026\nKanye:\n Okay, alright. It says\u2014wait a second, you sound sad.\nTaylor:\n Well, is it gonna be mean?\nKanye:\n No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mean.\nTaylor:\n Okay, then let me hear it.\nKanye:\n Okay, um \u2026 and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like \u201cHuh? What? That\u2019s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.\u201d And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, \u201cOh God, this is the craziest sh\u2014! This is why I love Kanye,\u201d that kind of thing. It\u2019s like my wife\u2019s favorite f\u2014ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?\nTaylor:\n Okay.\nKanye:\n \nSo it says, \u201cTo all my Southside n\u2014 that know me best\/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.\u201d [chuckles]\nTaylor:\n [chuckles] That\u2019s not mean.\nKanye:\n Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I\u2019m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it\u2019s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, \u2018Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s super genius to have you be the one that says, \u2018Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it\u2019s like, I got like s\u2014 on my album where I\u2019m like, \u201cI bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain\u2019t love the same bitch.\u201d\nTaylor:\n Oh my [laughs].

I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I\u2019m asked about, of course I\u2019m gonna be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d but um, I\u2019ll think about it.\nKanye:\n Yeah, you don\u2019t have to do\u2014you don\u2019t have to do the launch and retweet. That\u2019s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that\u2019s cool, then that\u2019s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.\nTaylor:\n You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they\u2019re gonna be like, \u201cWow,\u201d like this thing\u2014like they\u2019ll just turn it into something that \u2026 I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it\u2019ll be less cool \u2018cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, \u2018cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it\u2019s like almost \u2026 I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?\nKanye:\n Yeah.\nTaylor:\n \nI try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I\u2019m like this close to overexposure.\nKanye:\n Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.\nTaylor:\n I know, it\u2019s like a compliment, kind of [laughs].\nKanye:\n I had this line where I said\u2014and my wife really didn\u2019t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, \u201cTo all my Southside n\u2014 that know me best\/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,\u201d and my wife was really not with that one. \nShe was way more into \u201cShe owes you sex,\u201d but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s\u2014 that I was like, \u201cAhhh.\u201d\nTaylor:\n That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m kind of\u2014I mean, they\u2019re both really edgy, but that\u2019s the only thing about that line is that it\u2019s like gonna \u2026 It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don\u2019t give a fuck, so\u2026\nKanye:\n \nYeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make\u2014\nTaylor:\n That\u2019s sweet.\nKanye:\n \u2014you feel good. I don\u2019t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I\u2019m mad at Nike, so people think like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor.

Khaled!\n[Verse 1: Scarface]\nGotta be careful who you trusting\nBe aware of your surroundings when you hustling\nThem niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg\nAll the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all\nYou fuck with dude, he your day one\nAlmost had it all then the day comes\nWhen they walking through your house with the strap out\nPoint it at your head, got the bread then you blacked out\nBright lights down the hallways\nLeft his best friend for dead for the small wage\nThey say that every dog's got a day coming\nIt's like you seein' a ghost but he ain't say nothing\nEyes wide shut like you looking at me\nWindow pane to the soul say they niggas happy\nBut the pictures say them words we ain't tryna stomach\nThe homie didn't keep it one hundred\nThe cops doing round-ups, say they got a suspect\nFinally got a name now I'm stunned thinkin \"Fuck that\" (Fuck that)\nFor the money, niggas murder what they close to (Get this nigga)\nEntire families, these motherfuckers ghost you\nSmoke you, was it worth what the life was?\nJust prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz\nWas it worth what that life was?\nPrepare for the payback when it strikes cuz [Bridge: John Legend]\nCause when you need it the most\nAin't no one ever around\nCold world, cold world\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nYo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable\nHe fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to\nThe greats, they done already killed him, who you compare him to\nTo really figure out what he said will take a year or two\nFamily over everything,\n skills over politics\nHe don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it\nJust playing the hand you was dealt, no aces\nBetrayal is worse than death in most cases\nThe world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist\nMultiple shots to the face, no chasers\nMad cause you blew up quick and you excited\nYour man that you grew up with get you indicted\nThis was your nigga, yo, for him, you let the trigger go\nFound out at the trial they got audio and video\nShit don't always happen how you plan it\nGet jammed up and really find out who your fam is\nYou could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas\nThat nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas\nYou know when it's someone you love, the hurt's pure\nWhen you front tryna hold it in, it hurts more\nYou was right there back-to-back with me my first war\nEven had a crack spot together, the first floor\nUsed to buzz 'em in then meet 'em right by the first door\nThat was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour\nFriendship was worth more than a couple of ounces\nYou was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers\nInstead, you ended up somewhere far in the mountains\nTalking 'bout what we was doing, what we was counting\nNothing but old pictures of old sixes\nOld BM's with the kits, old Schnitzers\nTwo sides, both wishes\nKarma is the sister of life, they both bitches [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & \nMeek Mill\n]\nSee there's a story in my life\nThere's a story in my pain\nThere's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (\nYeah, for life\n)\nThere's a story in me\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nLord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends\nAnd I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends\nCause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance\nHomie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand\nDamn, say loyalty make a man\nGot a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand\nI don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child\nMan this game so foul but niggas made vows\nTo a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight\nThirty-six Os in the bird, call it featherweight\nNever on time, when I show up, I be ready late\nNiggas got fat while we starved, they already ate\nAnd I'm tryna get full, mask on, clip full\nIf he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull\nWe sellin' soft and sellin' hard like it's a brick store\nOn my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for\nHah!\n[Bridge: Akon & \nJohn Legend\n]\nMy pain ain't never been told (\nAin't never been told\n)\nAll the success that I'm suffering from\nCame from this knowledge I sold (\nThis knowledge I sold\n)\nMy family fucks with me\nAnd fought the enemy that stood in my way (\nIn my way\n)\nThat's why I don't trust nobody\nAnd I doubt you'll ever see that day [Chorus: Akon]\n'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)\nSurrender to you (Surrender)\nSurrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)\n[Bridge: John Legend & \nAnthony Hamilton\n]\nCause when you need it the most\nAin't no one ever around \n(Nobody's around)\nCold world \n(Cold world)\n cold world \n(Mmm, yes it is, yeah)\nAnd the ones that you keep close\nAre the ones that'll take you down (\nAlways take you down\n)\nCold world \n(Cold)\n a cold, cold world\n[Chorus: Akon & \nAnthony Hamilton\n]\n'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)\nSurrender to you (Surrender)\nSurrender to you (Surrender to you)\nFore I surrender to

but you racist\nLike bitch, that don\u2019t make no sense, but it is what it is\nYou know, he grew up, her callin' him a nig\nger\nThe kids at school callin' him a cracker\nIdentifying as black, looking as white\nBeing told what you can or can\u2019t be\nThis kid went through everything\nHe went through...\nHe saw narcotics in the household\nViolence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped\nThere was crazy shit that happened to this kid\nAnd he persevered while the whole world said\nWhat they said?\nSaid you wouldn\u2019t be shit!\nYou ain\u2019t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'\nNothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing\nAnd I, and he, he said fuck that, I\u2019ma persevere\nAnd that\u2019s why the message is always peace, love and positivity\nSee, he always saw things from two sides\nHe always saw things from two sides\nHe always knew that the message\nEverybody was born equal\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\nHe knew that because he saw that\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way)\nBecause he was stripped and torn down\nBy his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated\nAnd that did not know\nAnd he was stripped and he was torn down\nBy his white side that did not know\nThese people that are ignorant\nThat cannot see the bigger picture\nThat must fight and kill and murder each other\nBut once again, all he ever wanted to do\nWas spread a message of equality\nFor every man, woman, and child\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nNow imagine this child growing up\nAnd seeing the craziest shit\nBeing a part of the craziest shit\nRunning around

(Fuck you!)\nToday we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels\nBut first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)\nSay hi, Bob (\"Hi, Bob!\")\nBob's thirty and still lives with his mom\nAnd he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot\nBut his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot\nAnd Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot\nAnd wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock\nWhen it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog\nDrag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping block (Ahh!)\nAnd even if they escaped and they got the cops\nThe ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge\n'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job\nWhen she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk\nBut Stacey knew it was Bob and said, \"Knock it off!\"\nBut Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker\nCrazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka\nYou couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor\nHe grabbed Stace by the legs as he chopped it off her\nAnd dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her\nBut ever since the day Stacey went off to wander\nThey never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner\nAnd that's the story of Bob and his marijuana\nAnd what it might do to you\nSo see if the squirrels want it\u2014it's bad for you [Chorus]\nSee, children, drugs are bad (Come on)\nAnd if you don't believe me, ask your dad (You can ask)\nAnd if you don't believe him, ask your mom\n (That's right)\nShe'll tell you how she does 'em all the time\n (She will)\nSo kids, say no to drugs (That's right)\nSo you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)\nAnd there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)\nDrugs are just bad, mmkay?\n[Verse 2]\nMy penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?\nFuck no, you ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut! (Huh?)\nSpeakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?\nEcstasy is the worst drug in the world\nIf someone ever offers it to you, don't do it\nKids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid\nAnd spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back\nSo don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back\nMeet Zach: twenty-one years old\nAfter hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold\nAnd decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys\nAnd peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it\nSuddenly, he starts to convulse\nAnd his pulse goes into hyperdrive\nAnd his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)\nHis back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches\nHe's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)\nAnd everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him\n\"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!\"\n'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny\nSo they're laughing at basically nothing\nExcept maybe wasting their money\nMeanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over\nAnd his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga\nAnd that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac\nSo don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you [Chorus]\nSee, children, drugs are bad (That's right)\nAnd if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)\nAnd if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)\nShe'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)\nSo kids, say no to drugs (Smoke crack)\nSo you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)\nAnd there's really nothin' else to say (Right on)\nDrugs are just bad, mmkay?\n[Verse 3]\nAnd last but not least, one of the most humongous\nProblems among young people today is fungus\nIt grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up\nAnd you put it right in your mouth and chew it\nYum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff\nAnd everything slows down when you eat some of 'em\nAnd sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)\nLike fat women in G-strings with orange hair\n(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire\nWomen stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)\nAnd if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms\nWhoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus\nYour tongue gets all swole up like a cow's tongue\n(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)\nSee, drugs are bad, it's a common fact\nBut your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at\n (Eh?)\nBut don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD\nThey're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee\nAnd get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault\nSo don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you [Chorus]\nSee, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)\nAnd if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)\nAnd if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)\nShe'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)\nSo kids, say no to drugs (Say no)\nSo you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)\nAnd there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)\nDrugs are just bad, mmkay?\n[Outro]\nCome on, children, clap along! \n(Shut up!)\nSing along, children! \n(Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)\nCome on, clap along\nDrugs are just bad, drugs are just bad \n(\nSouth Park\n is gonna sue me!)\nSo don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)\nSo there'll be more for me \n(Hippie!

I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries.\nI\u2019m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I\u2019m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.\nThis is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field\u2026but will not get paid for a quarter of a year\u2019s worth of plays on his or her songs.\nThese are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.\nI realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period\u2026 even if it is free for the fans trying it out.\nThree months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.\nBut I say to Apple with all due respect, it\u2019s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don\u2019t ask you for free iPhones. Please don\u2019t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\nTaylor","prompt":"Write a song in the style of Taylor Swift that addresses the challenges and struggles of emerging artists in the music industry, focusing on the theme of fair compensation for artists during streaming service trials.

[inaudible]. I want you to explain what the problem with education is.\n[Summer]\nThe problem with education is they don\u2019t stick up for minorities or people who aren\u2019t in [inaudible]\u2026 [Kanye]\nHold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point.\n[Audience]\nYes sir.\n[Kanye]\n[inaudible] then explain the issue.\n[Summer]\nMy name is Summer [?]. I\u2019d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color\u2026\n[Kanye]\nI know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say \"Mm-hmm I feel that\" or \"Mm-hmm, I feel that\". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, \"I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves\" because I don\u2019t love the word, I. Which I get the [inaudible].\nWhen she says, We have completely expressed our point\u2026[interrupted] who is that?\n([We can\u2019t hear you in the back])\nYou can\u2019t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?\nYou see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we\u2019re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.\n[Kanye]\nSummer\u2026Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I\u2019m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let\u2019s go. [Summer]\nOkay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they\u2019re not teaching all of history. They\u2019re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victor's perspective. That\u2019s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we\u2019re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it\u2019ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It\u2019ll teach people how to love each other.\nThere\u2019s just so much wrong with education, some people don\u2019t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don\u2019t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don\u2019t know that. There\u2019s so much wrong with the education that we can\u2019t keep up with\u2026\n[Kanye]\n[inaudible], history.\nSummer\u2019s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.\n[Summer]\nIs that okay with you guys?\n[Audience]\nYes!\n[Kanye]\nWait a second. It doesn\u2019t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that\u2026\nQuiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.\n[Audience]\nYes!\n[Kanye West]\nSo, me as the leader of the free world, it's time for the very first round. [Audience]\nYes!\n[Kanye]\nInside of the very first rally. [crosstalk] I\u2019ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.\n[Summer]\nOkay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn\u2019t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he\u2019s right. He\u2019s Kanye West.\n[inaudible] social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.\n[Kanye]\nPause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.\nNow Summer, go ahead.\n[Summer]\nSo on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it\u2019s in complete dismay.\nSummer: (06:04)\nThere\u2019s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there\u2019s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone\u2019s opinions. You don\u2019t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that\u2019s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.\nKanye West: (06:04)\nRaise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.\nLauren: (06:04)\nMy name is Lauren McLeod.\nKanye West: (06:04)\nThis is Lauren McLeod.\nKanye West: (08:43)\nI understand everyone is excited, it\u2019s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God\u2026we have someone who isn\u2019t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally\u2026Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? [inaudible 00:08:49]. Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we\u2019re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it\u2019s outside, you\u2019d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn\u2019t have the car directly outside, I\u2019d have it on the other side of the street. So you\u2019d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.\nKanye West: (09:32)\nAnd that\u2019s what social media\u2026Quiet. That\u2019s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I\u2019m just walk\u2026I don\u2019t know where these bricks come from, but I\u2019m going to use them.\nKanye West: (09:33)\nWait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?\nAudience: (09:33)\nNo.\nKanye West: (09:33)\nDid you put the bricks in the street? I\u2019m not talking about the riots, I\u2019m talking about the bricks in the 80s.\nAudience: (09:33)\nOh.\nKanye West: (09:33)\nWe\u2019re ready.\nLauren: (10:07)\nEducation is an important topic. Education\u2026[inaudible 00:10:07]\nKanye West: (10:09)\nWe have no microphone.[inaudible 00:10:09]. You got it.\nLauren: (10:09)\nEducation starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we\u2019re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don\u2019t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There\u2019s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.\nLauren: (10:42)\n[inaudible 00:10:42], with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don\u2019t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don\u2019t feel comfortable going to the doctor\u2019s, don\u2019t feel comfortable going to vote, if you\u2019re not able to go and vote?\nKanye West: (11:09)\nOkay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I\u2019ve got to [inaudible 00:11:09], I got to take everything quite serious. I\u2019m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I\u2019m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.\nKanye West: (11:26)\nIn Europe, there\u2019s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.\nKanye West: (11:34)\nPercocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this [inaudible 00:11:34] mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That\u2019s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.\nKanye West: (12:34)\nIt said he was high as a mother-\u2026No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next\u2026No, because the next thing is the same thing. It\u2019s a cycle. It\u2019s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.\nKanye West: (12:55)\nUno memento\u2026wait you come here for the next statement\u2026you said can I\u2026who\u2019s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish\u2026\u201dImma let you finish\u201d\nLauren: (12:55)\nOkay, well I have a statement about pride and how it\u2019s different\u2026\nKanye West: (12:55)\nAbout pride.\nLauren: (13:41)\nYeah, different places in the United States are trying to [inaudible 00:13:41]. I grew up in [inaudible 00:13:41]. I repeat [inaudible 00:13:48]. [inaudible 00:13:47], they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn\u2019t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. [inaudible 00:13:55], dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you\u2019re back in class that day or the next day. It\u2019s not a fair [inaudible 00:14:03]. If we don\u2019t acknowledge that, nothing\u2019s going to change. There\u2019s still white people, black people, every single person [inaudible 00:14:09], truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we\u2019re raised and the way we experience the world.\nLauren: (13:41)\nAnd I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.\nKanye West: (14:51)\nI understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I\u2019m going to explain to you that Democrats ain\u2019t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that\u2019s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I\u2019m going to split the Black votes.\nKanye West: (14:55)\nThis reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s character in Django? [crosstalk 00:14:59].\nKanye West: (14:58)\nStephen\u2026Okay, right, right. I\u2019m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don\u2019t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven\u2019t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that\u2019s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.\nKanye West: (15:38)\nThe National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.\nKanye West: (16:03)\nTalking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don\u2019t see them. You don\u2019t see the real power. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s the head of the boards.\nKanye West: (16:41)\nIn risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don\u2019t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman\u2026you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn\u2019t start the movement. She couldn\u2019t put the bricks in the streets. I don\u2019t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.\nKanye West: (17:59)\nWe pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God\u2019s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God\u2019s people. There\u2019s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God\u2019s people. There\u2019s not left, right, red, blue. That\u2019s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I\u2019ve never got next to someone who didn\u2019t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we\u2019re doing the same thing. We\u2019re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let\u2019s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I\u2019m giving them the 15% royalty.\nKanye West: (19:15)\nWait a second, I don\u2019t want to hear\u2026I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I\u2019m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God\u2019s people. He sent pause\nKanye West: (20:24)\nHe set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.\nKanye West: (20:47)\nI see you have your hands up, walk up here, you\u2019re going to get your chance\u2026yes you, young lady walk up here.\nKanye West: (21:05)\nNow let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you\u2026I\u2019ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So\u2026one more minute sir we can talk. I\u2019m going to have my talk and then I\u2019m going to do Planned Parenthood.\nKanye West: (21:09)\nSo\u2026[inaudible 00:21:10] [inaudible 00:21:10] most likely speak Spanish here. No\u2026 we\u2019re going to be [inaudible 00:21:26] most original languages and we, all these people,[inaudible 00:21:26]. So, and there are illegal, so called\u2026, there\u2019s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a\u2026for the country that they\u2019ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.\nKanye West: (21:47)\nThe statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don\u2019t give a f***, I\u2019m going to word it like [inaudible 00:22:16].\nKanye West: (22:19)\nSo my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don\u2019t tell me I get it [inaudible 00:22:23] that sh** AIDS, that\u2019s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I\u2019m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.\nKanye West: (22:22)\nSo, I\u2019m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God [inaudible 00:22:52]. Because I was having like a rapper\u2019s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it\u2019s a wrap, the baby\u2019s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.\nKanye West: (23:19)\nYou already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I\u2019m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I\u2019m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we\u2019re going to have this baby. I said we\u2019re going to have this child.\nKanye West: (24:03)\nI know people who are 50 years old that didn\u2019t have children. They didn\u2019t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I\u2019ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn\u2019t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.\nKanye West: (24:30)\nYou know who else protected a child? Who do you think might\u2019ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.\nKanye West: (24:58)\n[inaudible 00:24:58].\nAudience: (24:58)\nWe love you Kanye.\nKanye West: (24:58)\nI almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.\nKanye West: (28:50)\nAnd then they said to me, You can\u2019t, you can\u2019t tell them about this story, you\u2019re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a [inaudible 00:28:50] deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They\u2019re going to run this. They\u2019re going to try to tell you that I\u2019m crazy, the world\u2019s crazy. I love my daughter.\nKanye West: (28:50)\nMy idea\u2026no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can\u2019t have a Plan A option?\nAudience: (28:50)\nNo.\nKanye West: (28:50)\nCalm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.\nSpeaker 1: (28:51)\nWhat about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness? [inaudible 00:28:51] What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you\u2019re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?\nKanye West: (28:51)\nNow everyone be quiet so you can hear us. [inaudible 00:27:18]. Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.\nSpeaker 1: (28:51)\nSingle moms with no family. Single moms\u2026\nKanye West: (28:51)\nExactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. [inaudible 00:27:47]. How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there\u2019s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking\u2026you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.\nAudience: (28:51)\nYes.\nSpeaker 1: (28:51)\nKanye, I love you. [inaudible 00:28:18]. You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don\u2019t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don\u2019t think we should get rid of abortions.\nKanye West: (28:51)\nLet me tell you. The Bible says\u2026\nSpeaker 1: (28:56)\nThe Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.[inaudible 00:28:56].\nKanye West: (29:10)\nWhen I said I had\u2026[inaudible 00:29:10].[inaudible 00:29:21]. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren\u2019t good enough as they saw it in the world.\nKanye West: (30:06)\nAmber started crying when she saw that. That\u2019s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I\u2019m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn\u2019t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the\u2026I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce [inaudible 00:30:35], I mean of getting an abortion.\nKanye West: (30:39)\nI understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I\u2019ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can\u2019t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.\nKanye West: (31:16)\nPeople always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won\u2019t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I\u2019m saying is, we understand, we\u2019re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that\u2019s there. We understand the conditions.\nKanye West: (32:03)\nBreak every store that\u2019s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says \u201cHey, I can do this stuff.\u201d\nKanye West: (32:24)\nWhen a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it\u2019s because I can do that. [crosstalk 00:32:39] So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, \u201cHe compared abortion to gold teeth.\u201d Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.\nGeorgia: (33:00)\nWhat are you? Nothing? [crosstalk 00:33:00]\nKanye West: (33:07)\nI am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason\u2026 What\u2019s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.\nSpeaker 2: (33:18)\nWhy\u2019d you delete it?\nKanye West: (33:24)\nBecause I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I\u2019m saying is, I\u2019ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone\u2026 In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in [inaudible 00:33:43] looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.\nKanye West: (34:00)\nWhat I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why\u2026 You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example. [crosstalk 00:34:23] Does anyone know [crosstalk 00:34:23] TMZ.\nSpeaker 2: (34:23)\nF*** TMZ!\nKanye West: (34:23)\n[crosstalk 00:34:23] quiet down, right? So let\u2019s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that\u2019s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?\nAudience: (34:35)\nYeah.\nKanye West: (34:37)\nOkay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby\u2019s mama and y\u2019all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y\u2019all get in an argument and she says, \u201cMy house, my choice. I\u2019m going to kill your child.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don\u2019t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019m not here to [crosstalk 00:35:22].\nKanye West: (35:23)\nI care that it\u2019s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it\u2019s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much [inaudible 00:35:31] because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m like an employee [crosstalk 00:35:39] this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. [crosstalk 00:35:50]\nKanye West: (35:34)\nHow do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?\nSpeaker 2: (35:34)\nWhen we steal.\nGeorgia: (35:34)\nWhen we lie.\nKanye West: (35:34)\nWhen we steal. How else?\nGeorgia: (35:34)\nWhen we lie.\nKanye West: (35:34)\nLie.\nAudience: (35:34)\nCheat.\nKanye West: (36:06)\nWhen we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land. [crosstalk 00:36:25] I don\u2019t think the last\u2026 [inaudible 00:36:29] a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.\nAudience: (36:53)\n[inaudible 00:36:53] Talk up! [inaudible 00:37:02] [crosstalk 00:37:12]\nKanye West: (37:19)\nWait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I\u2019m over. And if I\u2019m over right now, guess what else is over. The country\u2019s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn\u2019t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.\nGeorgia: (38:04)\nI just think my [inaudible 00:38:04]. I don\u2019t think we should say [crosstalk 00:38:15].\nKanye West: (38:20)\nLet me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for [crosstalk 00:38:31]. Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what\u2019s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. [crosstalk 00:39:11]\nKanye West: (39:14)\nMaximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that. [crosstalk 00:39:20] Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that\u2019s worked five [crosstalk 00:39:29]. We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. [crosstalk 00:39:57]\nKanye West: (39:57)\nWhen you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, \u201cBro.\u201d And then what else did I say? I said, \u201cListen to the [crosstalk 00:40:21], bro. Listen to the kids, bro.\u201d And are we running in 2020?\nAudience: (40:29)\nYep. Yeah.\nKanye West: (40:31)\nOkay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place? [crosstalk 00:41:02] But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she\u2019s saying I don\u2019t have the funding\u2026 Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. [crosstalk 00:41:12]\nKanye West: (41:12)\nLet me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, \u201cI\u2019m about a [crosstalk 00:41:13] thousand dollar stipend,\u201d but that\u2019s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, \u201cOkay, this person is mentally ill. This person is [crosstalk 00:41:41].\u201d Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It\u2019s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can\u2019t fix things. Money\u2019s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, all the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can\u2019t do and what God will do. [crosstalk 00:42:28]\nKanye West: (42:27)\nOne second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes. [crosstalk 00:42:40] wait a second. You need to hear this. [crosstalk 00:42:54] this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?\nKanye West: (43:19)\nWe got, we\u2019re going to have to, you\u2019re very [crosstalk 00:43:20]. Come up here, you\u2019re third. [crosstalk 00:43:20] I\u2019ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Wait a second. I must [crosstalk 00:43:20] that I did smoke a little bit last night. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free. [crosstalk 00:44:26] Light up right now. [crosstalk 00:44:40] Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You\u2019ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What\u2019s your name, sir? Gary, you\u2019re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that [crosstalk 00:44:55] Michael Jackson\u2019s home. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. [crosstalk 00:45:00]\nAudience: (43:19)\nI love Michael!\nKanye West: (43:19)\nOh, do we still love Michael?\nAudience: (45:11)\nYeah! [crosstalk 00:45:11]\nKanye West: (45:11)\nDo y\u2019all love Cosby? Y\u2019all love Bill Cosby?\nAudience: (45:17)\nYeah! [crosstalk 00:45:17]\nKanye West: (45:17)\nBe quiet. He\u2019s talking about opioids.\nGary: (45:17)\nI want to talk about opioids and [inaudible 00:45:39].\nAudience: (45:17)\nSpeak up!\nGary: (45:17)\nIt\u2019s like the treatment. We\u2019re addicted to the treatment.\nKanye West: (45:55)\nAnd by the way, we\u2019re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y\u2019all looked up what y\u2019all likes are when you post something? That\u2019s a form of treatment. Y\u2019all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that \u201cgetting treated\u201d. When y\u2019all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don\u2019t even know who that person is.\nAudience: (46:13)\nNobody!\nKanye West: (46:14)\nThat\u2019s the person that\u2019s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to [crosstalk 00:46:14]\nGary: (46:14)\nI\u2019m saying we\u2019re addicted to the treatment. They\u2019re trying to [crosstalk 00:46:14].\nKanye West: (46:14)\nWhat I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have [crosstalk 00:46:40] more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There\u2019s a solution for big pharm. There\u2019s a solution with that. I tell you this, I\u2019m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity. [crosstalk 00:47:00] Okay, Aisha\u2019s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.\nKanye West: (48:00)\nBecause I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about\u2026no I don\u2019t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain\u2019t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?\nKanye West: (48:07)\nNo that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. I told\u2026don\u2019t step up but what\u2019s your name? Tell the people what your name is. [inaudible 00:48:07].\nKanye West: (48:07)\nHey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I\u2019ll tell you what.\nKanye West: (48:07)\nReal talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. [inaudible 00:49:18].People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China\u2026I actually couldn\u2019t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\nKanye West: (49:50)\nWhen I talked to the billionaire\u2026it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It\u2019s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and [inaudible 00:50:54] through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said \u201cOkay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?\u201d Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There\u2019s a reason\u2026would you agree that there\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s never been a class on that?\nKanye West: (51:14)\nBecause ever time I talk, you\u2019re directly behind me saying something. What I\u2019m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I\u2019ve told you, the whole time I\u2019m talking to a hundred people, two hundred\u2026it started with a hundred people it\u2019s down to [inaudible 00:52:24] people. And every time that you make a comment [inaudible 00:52:32].\nKanye West: (52:53)\nAnd you are adding to the attention of them not understanding [inaudible 00:52:53]. That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?\nShiloh: (53:36)\nI have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the [inaudible 00:53:36] free of slaves and how [inaudible 00:53:39]. Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about [inaudible 00:53:45].\nKanye West: (54:36)\nI will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I\u2019m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don\u2019t think I know how to listen? [inaudible 00:55:17]. No they know everyone\u2019s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don\u2019t gap me. On God.\nKanye West: (59:38)\nI appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible\u2026you\u2026 disrespecting [inaudible 00:56:05].\nKanye West: (59:38)\nYou know what\u2026you know what\u2019s so funny? [inaudible 00:56:33]. We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That\u2019s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it\u2019s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don\u2019t own anything in it. You stay looking bad\u2026I believe we\u2019re all beautiful. It\u2019s not about how we look. It\u2019s about our hearts. It\u2019s about what\u2019s in our souls.\nKanye West: (59:38)\nNow, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that\u2019s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.\nKanye West: (59:38)\nI\u2019m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don\u2019t even know who you are.\nKanye West: (59:38)\n400 years is related to the bible. [inaudible 00:58:19] African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say \u201cJesus\u201d anytime we want. But we got educated, we\u2019re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.\nKanye West: (59:38)\nYou probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.\nKanye West: (59:39)\nGive me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don\u2019t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There\u2019s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be [inaudible 00:59:58] black church. That\u2019s some true sh**.\nKanye West: (01:00:19)\nEverybody\u2019s family\u2026everybody has everybody. Everybody\u2019s got some holier than thou worth. [inaudible 01:00:19]. Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle\u2026everybody. Everybody\u2019s family\u2026we all are imperfect human beings [inaudible 01:00:36]. Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I\u2019m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say \u201cThis is us.\u201d I do not\u2026I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.\nKanye West: (01:01:12)\nThat was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I\u2019m going to win in 2020.

different show every night in front of a new crowd\nThat\u2019s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now\nSee me lose focus as I sing to you loud\nAnd I can\u2019t, no, I won\u2019t hush\nI\u2019ll say the words that make you blush\nI\u2019m gonna sing this now\nSee, I\u2019m true, my songs are where my heart is\nI'm like glue I stick to other artists\nI'm not you, now that would be disastrous\nLet me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures\nSee, I\u2019m real, I do it all, it\u2019s all me\nI\u2019m not fake, don\u2019t ever call me lazy\nI won\u2019t stay put, give me the chance to be free\nSuffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I

bluffing\nName\u2019s on the credits and you didn\u2019t write nothing\nI sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool\nI will blast and I didn't go to Brit school\nI came fast with the way I act, right\nI can\u2019t last, if I\u2019m smoking on a crack pipe\nAnd I won\u2019t be a product of my genre\nMy mind will always be stronger than my songs are\nNever believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya\nAlways read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia\nMusically I\u2019m demonstrating\nWhen I perform live, feels like I am meditating\nTimes at the enterprise when some fella filmed me\nA young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou

in this cold world is to make music and use it\nNot to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music\nWho did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?\nChitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me\nAll I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely\nTo be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?\nHey, so I keep singing that\nWhen I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters\nBecame invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar\nAnd made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark\nAnd then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody\nHennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block\nWho said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?\nI'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy\nWith my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die\nSo see the signs, stand to the side\nOpen your eyes and take a look and realize\nThe resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears\nI arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar\nUrban Angel rising from the ashes\nSurprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou can find me in the club, bottle full of bub\nMummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs\nInto having sex, I ain't into making love\nCome give me a hug if you're into getting rough\nYou can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly\nMummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs\nInto having sex, I ain't into making love\nCome give me a hug if you're into

burning, I've been burning, burning, burning\n[Verse 4]\nNow where I come from burning weed it is a habit\nA big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it\nCause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic\nCause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit\nYup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood\nOne of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should\nOne of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good\nBurning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel\nBut me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug\nAnd if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug\nWhere I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged\nWhere I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub\nWhere I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine\nI blaze high grade weed all the time!\n[Bridge]\nNow my eyes are red\nCause you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nAnd you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me

aiming it right\nI won't stop until my name's in lights\nWith stadium heights, with Damian Rice\nOn red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights\nBecause I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height and I gone hyper\nNever be anything but a singer\/songwriter, yeah\nThe game's over but now I'm on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track without a loop pedal\nPeople think that I'm bound to blow up\nI've done around about a thousand shows but\nI haven't got a house plus I live on a couch\nSo you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out\nWow, from day one I've been prepared\nWith V05 wax for my ginger hair\nNow I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of\nWhat the future holds cause it's another day\n[Verse 6]\nRucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows\nI'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know\nOn tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant\nIf you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate\nMy flows developing, skin lacks the melanin\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\nDo it for the hell of it\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit\nI took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image\nPut in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick\nThe fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses\nWake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\nWorld's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is\nHard bars sharp like a cactus is\nI'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing\nI'm back to sing this\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man\n[Verse 7]\nI'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic\nAnd I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nInto another rapper shoes using new laces\nI'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the mustache\nI hit back, when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though\nAccording to the MySpace and YouTube videos\nI'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio\nMelody music maker, reading all the papers\nThey say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you\nYou need me, man, I don\u2019t need you at all\nYou need me man\nDon't need
