Nope\nBut I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at\nThis and put emphasis on the \"dope\"\nSo when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it\nAnd don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow\nYou won't find anywhere\nWhen it fires and I unload, my pen explodes\n'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time\nLet insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it\nIn school I was so shy, timid\nTwo pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member\nBeggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors\n\u2018Cause those were new, St. Vincent de Paul\nThose Pony's were used, and no size fitted\nBut kissed them old days, adi\u00f3s, I did it\nThey said I was a gimmick\nNow I'm the one that those guys mimic\nNow you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument\n\u2018Cause you know I'll win it\nName a flow that's more authentic, and don't front [Chorus: Buckshot]\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\nDon't front, you know I got you open, word\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\nYo, why you frontin'?\nYou know I got you open, kid\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nRest in peace to Big Proof\nYou was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me\nMolded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me\nI love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete\nI'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet\nI'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne\nBetter watch the fuckin' tone that you speak\nFeel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league\nOn my motherfuckin' own, it's just me\nNo opponents can compete\nAnd I've never been known to retreat\nFrom beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat\nI'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say \"Bon app\u00e9tit\"\n\u2018Cause I don't know what to eat\nFuckin' microphone or the beat\nBitch, nobody's mind works like mine\nIt's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown\n\u2018Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed\nUp in the Ebony Show-case\nWith Denaun screamin' \"Who the fuck passed you the mic?\"\nNever asked you to like my shit from the get\nI'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch\nYou had you a nice run, now take a hike\nI ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first\n\u2018Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers\nThe real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'\nWord to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?\nYou don't like it? Suck a cock, almost forgot\nBefore I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down\n\u2018Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud\nThey jerked me around, so what's up now?\nWow, how much of an asshole would I sound like\nRubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now?
