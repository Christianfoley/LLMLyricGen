rap's supposed to sound\nYa'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds\nIn your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town\nShout to the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash but boy (What up doe)\nThere's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid\nAnd I'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like half destroyed\nLike a meteor hit it well there went Melle Mel we lost his ass to roids (Damn)\nGod was like \"I got him\" but I'm gonna start him at the bottom of the barrel brought him in the world\nWith a ma that was on valium and his father was a coward taught him as a child when no fucking body was around\nHow to get himself up and out of poverty and now not even a growl in his stomach gotta be a hound\n'Til they put your body in the ground probably gonna sound like a clich\u00e9 but when haters try to beat you down\nSay fuck 'em [Chorus: Ez Mil]\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Outro: Eminem]\nI'm just playin', Gen Z, you know I love you",
