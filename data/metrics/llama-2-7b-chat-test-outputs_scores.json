The beat is moody and trap-influenced, reflecting themes of betrayal and resilience. The lyrics are layered with complex metaphors and braggadocio, typical of Drake's music, and the tone is defiant and confident. The song also has a contrasting softer note in the outro, hinting at personal connections and vulnerability, which is a signature element of Drake's music.",

The chorus reflects on the pain of the breakup and the struggle to move forward, while maintaining 21 Savage's characteristic blend of raw honesty and street-wise toughness. The vivid imagery and metaphors used throughout the song aim to resonate with themes of love lost and the struggle to move forward, while also showcasing the emotional depth and introspection that can be found in 21 Savage's music.",

The lyrics are personal and confessional, and maintain a balance between vulnerability and strength. The central theme of the song is the importance of creating music for passion and love, rather than for financial gain. The chorus repeats this theme, emphasizing the importance of staying true to oneself and one's art, even when it goes against the mainstream. The song also touches on the challenges of standing up for one's beliefs and values in the face of industry pressure, but ultimately conveys a message of determination and resolve.",

The lyrics reflect a heady mix of hedonism and confidence, with a blend of melodic hooks and hard-hitting verses that boast about wealth, street credibility, and sexual conquests. The song has two distinct parts, \"Poet\" and \"Parade,\" each with its own vibe and mood. The first part, \"Poet,\" has an introspective vibe, while the second part, \"Parade,\" switches to an energetic and celebratory mood, as if leading a parade of luxury and excess. The song's chorus is catchy and memorable, with a repetitive hook that emphasizes the idea of being on top of the world and invincible against legal troubles. Overall, this song would be a great addition to Travis Scott's discography and would undoubtedly appeal to his fans.",

The song also incorporates themes of hedonism and the complexity of relationships, with references to wealth, luxury, and the fast life.",

Kendrick's verse should have a gritty, streetwise feel, with a focus on the hustle and grind that lies at the heart of the song's message.\n\nOverall, the song should have a strong, empowering message that captures the confident and assertive vibe of a self-made success story. With its catchy hooks, dynamic range, and modern production, the song has the potential to become an anthem for anyone who's ever chased their dreams and made them a reality.",

The piano should play a prominent role in the arrangement, with a simple but effective melody that underscores the emotional intensity of the lyrics. The guitar should provide a subtle rhythmic accompaniment, while the strings should add depth and texture to the overall sound. The production should be stripped back and intimate, with a focus on showcasing the vocal performance.\n\nVocal Performance:\nThe vocal performance should be soulful and emotive, with a focus on conveying the longing and desire of the lyrics. The singer should have a strong, powerful voice that can convey the intensity of the emotions, as well as a softer, more vulnerable tone for the more introspective moments. The vocal delivery should be expressive and nuanced, with a focus on bringing the listener into the emotional world of the song.\n\nOverall, the song should be a powerful ballad that captures the essence of longing and desire for a loved one's presence and touch. The emotive lyrics, combined with the soulful and intimate musical arrangement, should create a sense of bliss and transportation for the listener, leaving them feeling moved and inspired.",

The lyrics reflect a sense of urgency and a plea for global solidarity, particularly in support of marginalized groups in Qatar, while maintaining the musical energy and signature pop sound characteristic of Michael Jackson's music. The spoken word elements directly call out institutions like FIFA, underscoring the song with an upbeat yet defiant tone that encourages spreading love over hate. The song's message of equality and justice is conveyed through a series of rhythmic chants and calls to action, emphasizing the need for legislative change and global solidarity.",

The male narrator, Drake, expresses his frustration and confusion about the woman he loves, who is always busy and seems to be playing games with him. The female vocalist adds her perspective, highlighting the challenges of being in a relationship where one person is trying to keep the other on a tight leash. The chorus captures the emotional rollercoaster of the relationship, with both parties feeling like fools and struggling to find their way. The song's laid-back but assertive rap flow and conversational tone are reminiscent of Drake's signature style, while the female vocalist's feature adds depth and complexity to the narrative.",

    "model_response":"Verse 1:\nI thought you were my home, my safe haven\nThe one I could always count on, through every storm\nBut now I'm standing here, with tears in my eyes\nRealizing you were the one who tore me apart\n\nYou promised to be there, through thick and thin\nTo love me unconditionally, until the end\nBut you lied, you cheated, you played me like a fool\nAnd now I'm left with nothing but broken rules\n\nChorus:\nYou said you'd be there, through the good and the bad\nBut now I'm standing here, feeling so sad\nThe promises you made, they meant nothing to you\nAnd now I'm left to pick up the pieces, feeling so blue\n\nVerse 2:\nI tried to hold on, but you kept on pushing\nAway the love we had, and the trust that was rushing\nYou said you needed space, but what you meant was time\nTo find someone new, and leave me in the dark, feeling so blind\n\nI gave you my heart, and you tore it apart\nWith your lies and your games, you broke it from the start\nI thought I was strong, but you showed me I'm not\nYou took my love, and you left me with nothing but regret\n\nChorus:\nYou said you'd be there, through the good and the bad\nBut now I'm standing here, feeling so sad\nThe promises you made, they meant nothing to you\nAnd now I'm left to pick up the pieces, feeling so blue\n\nBridge:\nI thought we had something real, something true\nBut now I'm left to wonder, what could have been, what I could have done\nI'm learning to let go, to move on from the pain\nBut it's hard to forget, the love we had, the love that remains\n\nChorus:\nYou said you'd be there, through the good and the bad\nBut now I'm standing here, feeling so sad\nThe promises you made, they meant nothing to you\nAnd now I'm left to pick up the pieces, feeling so blue\n\nOutro:\nI'll rise above, I'll find my way\nI'll learn to love again, someday\nBut for now, I'll just hold on to the pain\nAnd hope that someday, I'll find love again, without the strain.\n\nThis song captures the feeling of betrayal and heartbreak through the lens of Post Malone's style, with a moody and introspective vibe that blends elements of hip-hop and pop. The lyrics express the pain of being lied to by someone who promised to be there through thick and thin, and the chorus emphasizes the stark contrast between the promises made and the reality of the situation. The tone balances vulnerability with a touch of bitterness, reflecting on personal growth and resilience in the face of deceit.",

The chorus has a catchy and repetitive style similar to XXXTENTACION, while the verses have a clever wordplay and cultural references reminiscent of will.i.am's lyrical approach. The song has a hip-hop beat with potential for moody and atmospheric production elements to enhance the sense of longing and fixation expressed in the lyrics.",

The repetitive melodic hook symbolized by \"La, la, la\" chants helps to create a sense of continuity and progression throughout the song, while the dynamic shifts in the music mirror the transition from darkness to light, much like the metaphor of a butterfly's metamorphosis. The song also incorporates a mixture of singing and rapping, reflecting the introspective and personal nature of the lyrics.",

The beat should be steady and reliable, with a few deviations to create tension and emphasis.\n* The song should have a clear structure, with a verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format. This will help to build anticipation and create a sense of release when the chorus hits.\n\nOverall, the song should convey a sense of disillusionment with the current culture and a longing for truth and real connection. The musical composition should blend Timberlake's signature sound with a more introspective and emotional tone, creating a track that is both catchy and thought-provoking.",

The lyrics express the perspective of someone contemplating retaliating against their partner's unfaithfulness by cheating in return. The song incorporates Future's signature trap beats, melodic Auto-Tune, and raw emotional delivery, capturing the cycle of hurt, temptation, and the quest for empowerment through tit-for-tat actions. The narrative weaves both vulnerability and defiance, with references to status symbols and street culture akin to Future's musical storytelling. The chorus questions the worth of revenge and whether it will lead to true empowerment or just a cycle of pain.",

The lyrics convey a sense of longing and coping with the loss of a loved one, set against the backdrop of a year spent in isolation. The chorus emphasizes the slow passage of time and the persistence of memories of the person who's gone, with a musical composition that builds from contemplative verses to a more powerful and moving chorus. The use of metaphor, with the dancing alone with eyes closed, adds a sense of yearning and escape to the song, while the vivid emotional imagery and repetition of the chorus create a sense of nostalgia and longing.",

The Auto-Tuned vocals deliver introspective and hedonistic lyrics that convey the conflict between desire and conscience. The imagery in the lyrics conveys both the allure and the consequences of their choices, creating a sense of tension and ambiguity. The theme of the song revolves around the idea that desire and pleasure can be tempting, but they come at a cost, and the protagonists are aware of the moral ambiguity of their actions.",

The lyrics are written in a way that conveys a strong, confident persona who has moved on from a disappointing relationship and is now thriving. The metaphors and wordplay used throughout the song are meant to express the contrast between what was lost and what has been gained, and the catchy chorus highlights the resilience and independence of the protagonist. The song has a Latin pop feel with an urban twist, reflecting Shakira's signature sound and rhythmic vocal delivery.",
