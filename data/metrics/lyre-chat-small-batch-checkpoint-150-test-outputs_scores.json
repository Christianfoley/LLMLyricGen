to\no fire to go unnoticed\nThere's no way I'm just gonna pass him off like he's just some any rapper, like a one-hit wonder (\nYeah\n)\n[Verse 1: Ez Mil]\nI'm on whatever you on, I ain't gon' talk on the phone (Haha)\nKeep that same energy fuckin' with enemies\nIt's gettin' temptin' to run in your home, huh, huh (Run in that!)\nBuddy, I'd do it alone, cuddy said, \"Wait up my homes!\nDon't just go hit 'em 'cause I gotta drive you\nFocus on aimin' that blick at his dome!\" No cap\nYou motherfuckers be lucky as fuck that ain't nobody envious of you enough\nTake it from me like a brother who dug off the mud on his head but done ended up cuffed\nThen he just gets spat back out again into a world where he doubled what he did\n'Cause he learned \"give it up or get fucked in turn, homie\"\n[Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Verse 2: Ez Mil]\nI done got hit on the head, barely survived that shit (Okay)\nMinus a nine from ten, Eminem's spot still sits\nBut fuck a position, I'm tunin' him in\nLet all you rock out with it, I ain't ever gonna be an opt-out mission\nGet the Glock out with it, get to poppin', dip out and smoke\nWith the homies we mobbin', while I'm cleanin' the stash of my calibers\nSome of them might got ya' name on 'em\nWhile I brag about shit that could happen\nI am the reason that they got a chain on 'em\nWhen I rap, they consider me a Gatling\nFillin' up mags, I'm finna go clap 'em\nGettin' that bag with the G.O.A.T, B-Rabbit, I know they hate this flow\nI'm in the mode to get to killin' again with the best\nStick in your dome, you're never gettin' a penny or less\nStealin' the flows, then I'ma spit it again as a test\nSick of these hoes, they get to bitchin' the bigger the breast\nNevertheless I'ma get it in a way that you can never better\nInstead of settin' a bet up, I let up with the Beretta\nMake it \"dugu-dugu,\" drillin' you bitches in front of PETA\n'Cause I'm kinda gettin' fed up always leavin' y'all wet up like [Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nGuess I've really no right to complain much hip hop has been good to me huh\nBut when they say that I'm only top five 'cause I'm white why would I be stunned\nMy skin color's still working against me (What) 'cause second I should be to none\nBeing white ain't why they put me at five (Nope) it's why they can't put me at one (Whoot)\nThey're comin' with more venom so the haters I'm aimin' it towards them and\nAll the envious rappers I'd torch if I'm on a joint with 'em\nAnd that is the only retort is I'm not played in the clubs motherfucker put a cork in it\nOnly reason they still play your shit in the clubs (Why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em (Haha)\nI am a guest in this house but I turned this bitch to a mansion\nThat's an expansion made it gargantuan England Germany France and Japan's in this bitch\nEven Dubai because my music they do buy\nYou die tryin' this scientists two psy\n\u200bchiatrists could not un-screw my head up the blue eyed devil I never quit do I\nNaw cause you know you'll get washed like a bar of soap you pussy you wouldn't give a cigar to smoke\nAnd I know it eats at your heart like an artichoke because you know that's how likely you are to choke\nYour heart is broke as I rip you apart I go bananas precede to spit every bar I wrote\nI was spittin' before my mother's water broke it's not even close you bitch I'm by far the goat\nGen Zers actin' like rap experts zip up your gaps and close your mouths\nBitch you ain't been on this planet long enough to tell me how rap's supposed to sound\nYa'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds\nIn your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town\nShout to the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash but boy (What up doe)\nThere's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid\nAnd I'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like half destroyed\nLike a meteor hit it well there went Melle Mel we lost his ass to roids (Damn)\nGod was like \"I got him\" but I'm gonna start him at the bottom of the barrel brought him in the world\nWith a ma that was on valium and his father was a coward taught him as a child when no fucking body was around\nHow to get himself up and out of poverty and now not even a growl in his stomach gotta be a hound\n'Til they put your body in the ground probably gonna sound like a clich\u00e9 but when haters try to beat you down\nSay fuck 'em [Chorus: Ez Mil]\n'Cause I'm the realest in the
