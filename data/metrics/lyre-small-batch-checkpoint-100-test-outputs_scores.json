off the mud on his head but done ended up cuffed\nThen he just gets spat back out again into a world where he doubled what he did\n'Cause he learned \"give it up or get fucked in turn,

could happen\nI am the reason that they got a chain on 'em\nWhen I rap, they consider me a Gatling\nFillin' up mags, I'm finna go clap 'em\nGettin' that bag with the G.O.A.T, B-Rabbit, I know they hate this flow\nI'm in the mode to get to killin' again with the best\nStick in your dome, you're never gettin' a penny or less\nStealin' the flows, then I'ma spit it again as a test\nSick of these hoes, they get to bitchin' the bigger the breast\nNevertheless I'ma get it in a way that you can never better\nInstead of settin' a bet up, I let up with the Beretta\nMake it \"dugu-dugu,\" drillin' you bitches in front of PETA\n'Cause I'm kinda gettin' fed up always leavin' y'all wet up like [Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a

motherfucker put a cork in it\nOnly reason they still play your shit in the clubs (Why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em (Haha)\nI am a guest in this house but I turned this bitch to a

water broke it's not even close you bitch I'm by far the goat\nGen Zers actin' like rap experts zip up your gaps and close your mouths\nBitch you ain't been on this planet long enough to tell me how rap's supposed to sound\nYa'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds\nIn your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town\nShout to the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash but boy (What up doe)\nThere's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid\nAnd I'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like
