The song has a trap beat with atmospheric synths, and the Auto-Tuned vocals are laced with the energy of a night out in Paris. The lyrics touch on the glamour and glitz of high fashion and exclusive experiences, but also delve into the personal struggles of the wealthy, who may feel guilty or embarrassed about their privileged lifestyle.",

The lyrics reflect a sense of disorientation and escapism, transitioning into confidence and achievement, with a verse about feeling out of place yet somehow fitting in, a soaring chorus that emphasizes the high of success and being seen in a new light, and a drop that reinforces the theme of transformation. The language suggests a journey from the \"underground\" to the \"clouds,\" using imagery that conveys the feeling of a euphoric release after a period of hardship.",

The beat is moody and trap-influenced, reflecting themes of betrayal and resilience, and the lyrics are layered with complex metaphors and braggadocio typical of Drake's music. The outro provides a contrasting softer note, hinting at personal connections and vulnerability, showcasing Drake's ability to balance toughness with emotional depth.",

The lyrics emphasize the importance of loyalty to oneself and dismissing critics, with a gritty and atmospheric trap beat that incorporates autotuned vocals, reflecting a blend of hedonism and introspection similar to Travis Scott's musical and lyrical dynamics. The song is meant to be an anthem of self-empowerment and independence, with a message that resonates with listeners who value their autonomy and determination to succeed on their own terms.",

The melody should be reminiscent of Sam Smith's ballads, with a focus on carrying the weight of the lyrics and conveying the sense of gratitude and reverence for the steadfast partner. The use of imagery and metaphor, such as likening the partner to an angel, and the use of healing and clarity, should add to the emotional impact of the song. The bridge should add a sense of intimacy and vulnerability, highlighting the comfort and solace found in the partner's embrace. Overall, the song should convey a sense of deep appreciation and love for the steadfast partner, who provides unwavering support and healing through life's challenges.",

The person they are in a relationship with is changing over time, and the narrator can't keep up with the constant changes. They reflect on the age-related excuses for the person's behavior and wonder if they are the problem. The song incorporates a catchy refrain that emphasizes these disappointments, mimicking the conversational tone and the sharp, rhythmic delivery characteristic of Drake's music. The song also includes introspection and self-reflection, as the narrator ponders over the reasons for the person's behavior and the desire to move past the preoccupation with the person in question.",

The lyrics reflect a personal perspective, similar to a confessional style, and maintain a balance between vulnerability and strength. The central theme of the song is the importance of staying true to oneself and one's art, rather than compromising for the sake of commercial success. The repetition of the chorus, \"I'm doing it for the love, not for the money,\" serves as a mantra for the artist, and a reminder of the true reasons behind their creativity.",

The lyrics reflect a heady mix of hedonism and confidence, with a blend of melodic hooks and hard-hitting verses that boast about wealth, street credibility, and sexual conquests. The song has two distinct parts: the first part, \"Poet,\" has an introspective vibe, while the second part, \"Parade,\" switches to an energetic and celebratory mood, as if leading a parade of luxury and excess. I hope you enjoy it!",

The lyrics express themes of relentless pursuit and wild, nocturnal escapades, paired with the artist's signature auto-tuned vocals and ad-libs. The song has a dynamic structure that shifts from energetic verses to a catchy, melodic chorus, and a bridge that slows down the pace, creating a contrasting atmosphere. The lyrics also explore the complexity of relationships, with references to wealth, luxury, and the fast life, while also touching on the themes of love and loss. Overall, the song is an ode to living life to the fullest and pursuing one's passions with reckless abandon, while also acknowledging the complexities and contradictions that come with that lifestyle.",

hit 'em 'cause I gotta drive you\nFocus on aimin' that blick at his dome!\" No cap\nYou motherfuckers be lucky as fuck that ain't nobody envious of you enough\nTake it from me like a brother who dug off the mud on his head but done ended up cuffed\nThen he just gets spat back out again into a world where he doubled what he did\n'Cause he learned \"give it up or get fucked in turn, homie\"\n[Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Verse 2: Ez Mil]\nI done got hit on the head, barely survived that shit (Okay)\nMinus a nine from ten, Eminem's spot still sits\nBut fuck a position, I'm tunin' him in\nLet all you rock out with it, I ain't ever gonna be an opt-out mission\nGet the Glock out with it, get to poppin', dip out and smoke\nWith the homies we mobbin', while I'm cleanin' the stash of my calibers\nSome of them might got ya' name on 'em\nWhile I brag about shit that could happen\nI am the reason that they got a chain on 'em\nWhen I rap, they consider me a Gatling\nFillin' up mags, I'm finna go clap 'em\nGettin' that bag with the G.O.A.T, B-Rabbit, I know they hate this flow\nI'm in the mode to get to killin' again with the best\nStick in your dome, you're never gettin' a penny or less\nStealin' the flows, then I'ma spit it again as a test\nSick of these hoes, they get to bitchin' the bigger the breast\nNevertheless I'ma get it in a way that you can never better\nInstead of settin' a bet up, I let up with the Beretta\nMake it \"dugu-dugu,\" drillin' you bitches in front of PETA\n'Cause I'm kinda gettin' fed up always leavin' y'all wet up like [Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nGuess I've really no right to complain much hip hop has been good to me huh\nBut when they say that I'm only top five 'cause I'm white why would I be stunned\nMy skin color's still working against me (What) 'cause second I should be to none\nBeing white ain't why they put me at five (Nope) it's why they can't put me at one (Whoot)\nThey're comin' with more venom so the haters I'm aimin' it towards them and\nAll the envious rappers I'd torch if I'm on a joint with 'em\nAnd that is the only retort is I'm not played in the clubs motherfucker put a cork in it\nOnly reason they still play your shit in the clubs (Why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em (Haha)\nI am a guest in this house but I turned this bitch to a mansion\nThat's an expansion made it gargantuan England Germany France and Japan's in this bitch\nEven Dubai because my music they do buy\nYou die tryin' this scientists two psy\n\u200bchiatrists could not un-screw my head up the blue eyed devil I never quit do I\nNaw cause you know you'll get washed like a bar of soap you pussy you wouldn't give a cigar to smoke\nAnd I know it eats at your heart like an artichoke because you know that's how likely you are to choke\nYour heart is broke as I rip you apart I go bananas precede to spit every bar I wrote\nI was spittin' before my mother's water broke it's not even close you bitch I'm by far the goat\nGen Zers actin' like rap experts zip up your gaps and close your mouths\nBitch you ain't been on this planet long enough to tell me how rap's supposed to sound\nYa'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds\nIn your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town\nShout to the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash but boy (What up doe)\nThere's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid\nAnd I'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like half destroyed\nLike a meteor hit it well there went Melle Mel we lost his ass to roids (Damn)\nGod was like \"I got him\" but I'm gonna start him at the bottom of the barrel brought him in the world\nWith a ma that was on valium and his father was a coward taught him as a child when no fucking body was around\nHow to get himself up and out of poverty and now not even a growl in his stomach gotta be a hound\n'Til they put your body in the ground probably gonna sound like a clich\u00e9 but when haters try to beat you down\nSay fuck 'em [Chorus: Ez Mil]\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Outro: Eminem]\nI'm just playin', Gen Z, you know I love you",

The vocals should be melancholic and atmospheric, reminiscent of Justin Vernon, with vivid imagery and a sense of introspection and existential contemplation. The lyrics should reflect the struggle of finding one's place in a harsh and unforgiving world, using personal struggles, societal pressures, and a quest for meaning as the central themes.",

The chorus is catchy and memorable, with a repetition of the phrase \"growing up, growing old\" that serves as a central theme throughout the song. The bridge and outro add a sense of closure and finality to the narrative, solidifying the message of personal growth and maturity.",

The instrumental would feature a slow-burning, ambient beat, with lush, layered synths and a haunting melody that echoes the emotional complexity of the lyrics. The song would also incorporate a raw, emotive piano sample, which would be used to heighten the emotional impact of the lyrics. Throughout the song, the production would maintain a consistent, pulsing energy, which would build in intensity as the song progresses, mirroring the emotional intensity of the lyrics.\n\nLyrically, the song would maintain 21 Savage's characteristic raw and honest lyricism, while exploring themes of relationship fallout and introspective reflection on personal flaws. The lyrics would touch on the pain and heartbreak of a breakup, but also delve into the introspection and growth that can come from reflecting on past mistakes and learning from them. The song would be a blend of rap and melodic elements, with a focus on delivering a hook that would stick in listeners' minds and complement the emotional impact of the lyrics.\n\nOverall, the song would be a moody and introspective exploration of heartbreak and personal growth, with a blend of trap beats and melodic elements that would create a unique and emotive listening experience.",

The spoken dialogue in the verses helps to set up a narrative and adds a playful, funky vibe to the track. The repetition of the phrase \"funk ya to the top\" in the chorus and bridge is reminiscent of Mars' use of repetition in his songs, while the too-late realization of wanting to stay in the outro is a common theme in his music. Overall, this song is meant to encapsulate the infectious energy and smooth vocal delivery of Bruno Mars, while incorporating a unique and funky narrative.",

The lyrics incorporate vivid imagery and references to wealth and lifestyle, such as luxury brands and existential choices, balanced with a sense of groundedness in family and personal growth. The repetitive melodic hook symbolized by \"La, la, la\" chants, mirrors the transition from darkness to light, much like the metaphor of a butterfly's metamorphosis. The dynamic shifts in the music reflect the shift from darkness to light, creating a sense of uplift and redemption.",

The lyrics convey a sense of desperation and obsession, with a twisted sense of maturity and a skewed perception of love. The chorus is catchy yet chilling, reflecting the dangerous thoughts of harming an ex and their new partner out of a misguided desire to not be alone. The song builds up to a dramatic bridge, revealing the lengths the protagonist is willing to go for what they perceive as love, teetering on the edge of sanity, all while abstaining from substances, adding to the complexity of their emotions and actions.",

The verses should have a slower, more introspective pace, while the chorus should have a more upbeat, driving rhythm. The use of repetition in the chorus and verses should emphasize the themes of striving for acceptance and personal sacrifice, while the melancholic undertone of the song should reflect the emptiness of trying to fit in. The song should have a sense of urgency and desperation, as the protagonist struggles to find their place in the world and gain the approval of someone they admire.",

The song is about finding strength and resilience in the face of challenges, and rising up to overcome them, with a message of hope and empowerment that is reminiscent of Swift's storytelling approach.",

The lyrics express the perspective of someone contemplating retaliating against their partner's unfaithfulness by cheating in return, while also showcasing the vulnerability and defiance of the narrator. The use of Future's signature trap beats, melodic Auto-Tune, and raw emotional delivery creates a song that weaves together the themes of hurt, temptation, and the quest for empowerment through tit-for-tat actions. The references to status symbols and street culture add a layer of authenticity to the narrative, making it a powerful expression of the emotional and psychological dynamics at play in a relationship where trust has been broken.",

The lyrics touch on themes of fear, disillusionment, and a desire for freedom, while also expressing a sense of hopelessness and frustration with the state of the world. However, the song ultimately offers a message of hope and resilience, suggesting that we can come together and make a better future for ourselves.\n\nMusically, the song is written in a blend of pop and soul styles, with a strong emphasis on rhythm and energy. The lyrics are structured to allow for signature Michael Jackson vocal inflections and delivery, with a focus on catchy hooks and melodies. The use of repetition in the chorus, with the phrase \"All of this for nothing,\" creates a sense of urgency and frustration, while the bridge offers a message of hope and determination. The outro, with its emphasis on a brighter future, provides a sense of closure and resolution to the song.",

The instrumental should evoke the darker, more introspective side of Drake's sound, with a mix of piano, synths, and a slow-burning beat. The song should also incorporate elements of R&B and soul, to give it a more emotional and personal feel. The use of current cultural references and allusions to the lavish yet sometimes superficial lifestyle of celebrities will help to further emphasize the themes of complexity and paradox in the lyrics.",

The lyrics reflect on personal growth and success while emphasizing a strong sense of self and origins, with a cool detachment and a hint of nostalgia. The song also touches on the complexities of fame and navigating relationships, with a street-savvy attitude.\n\nThe song begins with the narrator running through the 6 (Toronto) with their woes, trying to find some peace but still recognized by someone from their past. The encounter is met with indifference and a sense of disconnection, as the narrator is too busy and successful to be bothered with nostalgia. The chorus introduces the theme of being the real deal, with a strong sense of self and pace, and a determination to keep grinding and shining.\n\nThe first verse sets up the narrator's success and fame, with references to luxury brands and loyalty to their roots and crew. The second verse continues to explore the complexities of fame, with a focus on maintaining a cool detachment and avoiding the trappings of success. The bridge highlights the narrator's resilience and strength, with a determination to keep their legacy intact and their crown on their face.\n\nThroughout the song, there are several references to Drake's signature flows and lyrical themes, including introspection, braggadocio, and a focus on personal growth and success. The song also features a catchy hook and smooth production, with a mix of R&B and hip-hop beats that would be reminiscent of Drake's sound.",

The imagery of fleeting lights, snow at the beach, and aurora borealis is used to convey a mix of wonder, impossibility, emotional vulnerability, and a sense of beauty in strange juxtapositions. The collaboration between Taylor and Lana creates a unique and beautiful love story, with a central metaphor of snow on the beach that is repeated throughout the song, emphasizing the beauty and impossibility of the unexpected love. The post-chorus and outro add to the theme of cautious hope in the face of love, with a sense of determination and commitment to make the love work despite the challenges and odds. The song's atmospheric bridge intensifies the theme of hope and vulnerability, and the use of repetition in the chorus and post-chorus creates a sense of unity and cohesion in the song.",

The melody is contemplative and introspective, building to a more powerful and moving chorus, with a focus on the pain of loss and the endless space that follows. The song is a reflection on the loss of a relationship, and the ways in which we cope with that loss through the metaphor of dancing alone with our eyes closed.",

The lyrics explore the cyclical nature of emotional dependency, conveying a mix of resignation and defiance through motifs like chemicals or intoxication. The song's vivid imagery sets the scene for the struggle of an addictive relationship, with lines like \"smokin' in the car\" and \"fightin' at the bar\" capturing the chaos and intensity of the connection.",
