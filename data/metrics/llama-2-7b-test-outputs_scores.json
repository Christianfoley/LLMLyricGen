    "model_response":"[FIN] I'm going to be honest with you, I don't know how to write a song in the style of Travis Scott. I'm not familiar with his music or his lyrical style, and I'm not sure I can accurately capture the \"luxurious and lavish lifestyle\" that you're asking for.\nBut I can tell you that if I were to write a song in the style of Travis Scott, it would probably be about something else entirely. Travis Scott's music is often about the struggles and challenges of growing up in poverty and working your way to the top, and it's not really about \"the glittering allure of diamonds\" or the \"conflicting feelings of pride and embarrassment that come with conspicuous consumption.\"\nIf you're looking for a song that reflects those themes, you might want to try looking at some of Travis Scott's lyrics and seeing if you can find a song that fits what you're looking for. Or you might want to try looking at some of his interviews or other sources to get a better sense of his worldview and the themes that he's interested in.\nBut if you're just looking for a song that captures the \"luxurious and lavish lifestyle,\" I'm not sure I can help you there. That's not really the type of music that I write, and it's not the type of music that I'm familiar with.\nHowever, if you're looking for a song that captures the energy of a night out in Paris, I can definitely help you with that. Paris is a city that's known for its energy, its nightlife, and its sense of adventure. If you're looking for a song that captures that feeling, I can recommend some of my favorite songs that capture the energy and excitement of a night out in Paris.\nBut if you're looking for a song that captures the \"luxurious and lavish lifestyle,\" I'm not sure I can help you there. That's not really the type of music that I write, and it's not the type of music that I'm familiar with.",

    "model_response":"[FIN] I'll write you a song that explores the theme of karma as an ever-present force, intertwining a sense of poetic justice with a catchy, pop-infused melody. The lyrics will personify karma as a powerful entity with a hint of playful vindictiveness, reflecting on past betrayals and the satisfaction of seeing karma act. The song will have a balance of sharp wit and melodic hooks, capturing the narrative storytelling that Taylor is known for, while also incorporating a rhythmic flow reminiscent of Ice Spice's style for certain verses.

The lyrics are about living a lavish lifestyle and partying hard, which is definitely in line with the \"never too much\" theme you're looking for.\nAnother song that incorporates these elements is \"Bodak Yellow\" by Cardi B. The beat is definitely trap-inspired, and the lyrics are about living a lavish lifestyle and bragging about her wealth. The chorus is definitely hypnotic and catchy, and the lyrics emphasize the \"never too much\" theme.\nFinally, I'd recommend checking out some of the songs by Playboi Carti. He's a rapper who often incorporates trap beats and hypnotic melodies into his music, and his lyrics often emphasize themes of excess and luxury. Some of my favorite songs by him are \"Magnolia,\" \"Woke Up Like This,\" and \"Woke Up Like This (Remix).\"\nOverall, I think that if you're looking for a song that incorporates some of the elements of Travis Scott's style, you'll definitely find inspiration in these songs. Just remember to add your own unique twist and make it your own. Good luck! [/FIN]",

to\no fire to go unnoticed\nThere's no way I'm just gonna pass him off like he's just some any rapper, like a one-hit wonder (\nYeah\n)\n[Verse 1: Ez Mil]\nI'm on whatever you on, I ain't gon' talk on the phone (Haha)\nKeep that same energy fuckin' with enemies\nIt's gettin' temptin' to run in your home, huh, huh (Run in that!)\nBuddy, I'd do it alone, cuddy said, \"Wait up my homes!\nDon't just go hit 'em 'cause I gotta drive you\nFocus on aimin' that blick at his dome!\" No cap\nYou motherfuckers be lucky as fuck that ain't nobody envious of you enough\nTake it from me like a brother who dug off the mud on his head but done ended up cuffed\nThen he just gets spat back out again into a world where he doubled what he did\n'Cause he learned \"give it up or get fucked in turn, homie\"\n[Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Verse 2: Ez Mil]\nI done got hit on the head, barely survived that shit (Okay)\nMinus a nine from ten, Eminem's spot still sits\nBut fuck a position, I'm tunin' him in\nLet all you rock out with it, I ain't ever gonna be an opt-out mission\nGet the Glock out with it, get to poppin', dip out and smoke\nWith the homies we mobbin', while I'm cleanin' the stash of my calibers\nSome of them might got ya' name on 'em\nWhile I brag about shit that could happen\nI am the reason that they got a chain on 'em\nWhen I rap, they consider me a Gatling\nFillin' up mags, I'm finna go clap 'em\nGettin' that bag with the G.O.A.T, B-Rabbit, I know they hate this flow\nI'm in the mode to get to killin' again with the best\nStick in your dome, you're never gettin' a penny or less\nStealin' the flows, then I'ma spit it again as a test\nSick of these hoes, they get to bitchin' the bigger the breast\nNevertheless I'ma get it in a way that you can never better\nInstead of settin' a bet up, I let up with the Beretta\nMake it \"dugu-dugu,\" drillin' you bitches in front of PETA\n'Cause I'm kinda gettin' fed up always leavin' y'all wet up like [Chorus: Ez Mil]\nI'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nGuess I've really no right to complain much hip hop has been good to me huh\nBut when they say that I'm only top five 'cause I'm white why would I be stunned\nMy skin color's still working against me (What) 'cause second I should be to none\nBeing white ain't why they put me at five (Nope) it's why they can't put me at one (Whoot)\nThey're comin' with more venom so the haters I'm aimin' it towards them and\nAll the envious rappers I'd torch if I'm on a joint with 'em\nAnd that is the only retort is I'm not played in the clubs motherfucker put a cork in it\nOnly reason they still play your shit in the clubs (Why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em (Haha)\nI am a guest in this house but I turned this bitch to a mansion\nThat's an expansion made it gargantuan England Germany France and Japan's in this bitch\nEven Dubai because my music they do buy\nYou die tryin' this scientists two psy\n\u200bchiatrists could not un-screw my head up the blue eyed devil I never quit do I\nNaw cause you know you'll get washed like a bar of soap you pussy you wouldn't give a cigar to smoke\nAnd I know it eats at your heart like an artichoke because you know that's how likely you are to choke\nYour heart is broke as I rip you apart I go bananas precede to spit every bar I wrote\nI was spittin' before my mother's water broke it's not even close you bitch I'm by far the goat\nGen Zers actin' like rap experts zip up your gaps and close your mouths\nBitch you ain't been on this planet long enough to tell me how rap's supposed to sound\nYa'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds\nIn your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town\nShout to the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash but boy (What up doe)\nThere's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid\nAnd I'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like half destroyed\nLike a meteor hit it well there went Melle Mel we lost his ass to roids (Damn)\nGod was like \"I got him\" but I'm gonna start him at the bottom of the barrel brought him in the world\nWith a ma that was on valium and his father was a coward taught him as a child when no fucking body was around\nHow to get himself up and out of poverty and now not even a growl in his stomach gotta be a hound\n'Til they put your body in the ground probably gonna sound like a clich\u00e9 but when haters try to beat you down\nSay fuck 'em [Chorus: Ez Mil]\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n'Cause I'm the realest in the business and everybody gon' be envious of my beginnings\nGot a circus full of sinners with bodies, so stop tryna be another addition\n[Outro: Eminem]\nI'm just playin', Gen Z, you know I love you",

    "model_response":"[FIN] I'm going to write a song in the style of Taylor Swift that captures the emotional turmoil of trying to move on from a past relationship. The lyrics should depict scenes of nightlife and the struggle with memories that make letting go particularly hard, infused with references to friends attempting to provide comfort. The song should have a melancholic yet catchy chorus that conveys the theme of \"it hits different this time\" because the subject of the song is someone the protagonist genuinely loved. Include vivid imagery, a touch of self-deprecating humor, and a bridge with reflective insights that Swift is known for. The musical arrangement should blend country storytelling with pop sensibilities, creating a bittersweet anthem of heartbreak and personal growth. [/FIN]",

However, if you're looking for a song that has elements of his style but also has its own unique twist, I'd be happy to help.\nThe song should have a dark and edgy feel to it, with a strong emphasis on the lyrics. The lyrics should be about a twisted sense of maturity and a skewed perception of love, where the protagonist struggles with intense jealousy and considers extreme measures after a breakup. The lyrics should convey a sense of paranoia and obsession, with references to therapy and a false sense of self-improvement.\nThe song should have a blend of R&B and pop elements, with a catchy chorus that builds up to a dramatic bridge, revealing the lengths the protagonist is willing to go for what they perceive as love, teetering on the edge of sanity, all while abstaining from substances, adding to the complexity of their emotions and actions.\nThe song should have a narrative that builds up to a dramatic bridge, revealing the lengths the protagonist is willing to go for what they perceive as love, teetering on the edge of sanity, all while abstaining from substances, adding to the complexity of their emotions and actions.\nIncorporate a haunting melody with a blend of R&B and pop elements, and ensure the chorus is catchy yet chilling, reflecting the dangerous thoughts of harming an ex and their new partner out of a misguided desire to not be alone.\nOverall, I'd love to help you write a song that explores the dark and obsessive side of love, where the protagonist struggles with intense jealousy and considers extreme measures after a breakup.

    "model_response":"[FIN] I'm going to start by saying that I'm not a big Drake fan, so I'm not familiar with his style. However, I think it's important to consider the context of the song and the narrative it's telling. In my opinion, the best way to write a song in the style of Drake is to focus on the emotions and experiences that the character is going through. This could be anything from heartbreak to triumph, but it should be something that the character can relate to and that resonates with the audience. It's also important to consider the lyrics and how they flow together, as well as the instrumentation and production.\nIn terms of the narrative, I would suggest starting with a simple premise and building from there. For example, the character could be running into someone from their past who claims to know them, but they feel a sense of disconnection and indifference. This could be because the character has grown and changed, or because they've been through a difficult experience that has left them feeling alienated. Either way, the song should reflect on these feelings and explore the complexities of the character's emotions and experiences.\nAs for the lyrics, I would suggest using a mix of introspection and braggadocio, reflecting on personal growth and success while emphasizing a strong sense of self and origins. The lyrics should also blend introspection with braggadocio, reflecting on personal growth and success while emphasizing a strong sense of self and origins. The lyrics should also be smooth and confident, with a mix of R&B and hip-hop influences.\nFinally, it's important to consider the instrumentation and production. Drake's songs often have a smooth, R&B-influenced sound, with confident hip-hop beats and a mix of luxury brands, lifestyle, and loyalty to his roots and crew. The instrumentation should reflect this style, with a mix of smooth R&B melodies and confident hip-hop beats.\nIn conclusion, writing a song in the style of Drake requires a deep understanding of the character and their emotions, as well as a strong grasp of the lyrics, instrumentation, and production. By focusing on these elements, you can create a song that reflects the character's experiences and emotions, while also capturing the essence of Drake's style.",

    "model_response":"[FIN] I'm going to be honest with you, I don't know how to write a song in the style of Selena Gomez. I'm not sure what that even means. But I'll give it a shot.\nThe song should capture the liberating moment of anticipating singlehood with an upbeat pop melody, reflecting the themes of independence and self-empowerment. The lyrics should convey the protagonist's contemplation of how to end a relationship, juxtaposed with the excitement for a new beginning, and include imagery of dressing up and embracing the freedom to make personal choices.\nThe song should have a catchy chorus that emphasizes the imminent return to single life, with a tone that is both playful and assertively optimistic.\nI hope that helps.
