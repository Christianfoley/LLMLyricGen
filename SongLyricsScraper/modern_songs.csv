I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still

Said you lied, shit, but you lied
Said you lied, shit, but you lied
You lied to me
[Chorus]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feelin' you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low, but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to mе, you lied to me
Said you'd die for mе, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah

I hope you think about me every time you touch it
I hope your new girl hears it and she loves it
Devil's front door and I'm bangin' on the line
If I said I want a answer, I'd be lyin', I'd be lyin', yeah
They say what the devil can't do
He's gon' send a woman to
You seek to hide, you're dead inside, won't see me cry

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feelin' you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low, but you were gettin' high with me

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah [Verse 2]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out I should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage, 
you can hear it in this verse, honey
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold forty million copies of our break-up note
Brought some strangers in our bed so now you lost your right to privacy
Spillin' all our secrets, you thought they'd probably die with me (Nope)
Know you fuckin' love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy 'cause I know, nothing's changed though

aid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feelin' you'd be lyin' to me
We were on the low, but you were gettin' high with me
Learned a lesson when you showed a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)

This is the last time, I'ma do you the honor
I gave you a headline, I know I shouldn't bother
This is a lesson to take, hold someone tight and they break
Then you say it's a mistake, but you meant it anyway
Now you can blame me, tell them you made me
Ignore the shit that you did on the daily
Think that you played me but you can save me
All of that shit 'bout how I'm fuckin' crazy [Chorus]

Juice WRLD

I'm the type to come in the game and just launch pain
With a bronze frame and a tattoo of my mom's name
This industry has nothin' to offer beyond fame
Time to take these niggas to school, LeBron James
Lesson one, I'm a bad teacher who gave the class seizures
Smash divas, stash reefer in the lab freezer
I found the reefer Cordae stashed in the back of the lab
So I'm in class, smokin' gas, slappin' the class preacher
Bring the house down on you hoes, Queen Latifah
I'm too fast, gettin' this cash
Get in the way, get your brain bashed
Chopper gon' smash, hittin' your face
I'ma tie up, just like a shoe, my flow laced
Y'all niggas so fake, wash your face in my showcase
Fresher than Colgate, make hoes wait, I hold weight
Bottle of Rosé in a Rolls, drivin' with road rage
For ten days, off Xans, just tryna get paid
And since the sixth grade, I been great, no sensei
My rent paid for ten days 'cause my pen's great
I smoke ten J's with two hoes that go both ways
Funny how two plus two equals foreplay
Speakin' of foreplay, had this shit in the hallway with
A nun on Sunday, I guess I'm just too blessed
 (Woah, ayy)
Me and my nigga Juice WRLD takin' over the Universe
You knew it first, got my mom Chanel with the newest purse
Birkin bag, never hurt to ask, ""What type of purse is that?""
Something that's very fuckin' expensive, I deserve to brag
I murder tracks, 
this isn't mumble, it's murder rap
Type of shit your grandma understand with her old ass
Spend a half a million, then go back and make some more cash
The hair trigger Brazilian, you would get your whole hood waxed
See, what you know about my life and my troubled past?
Took the shuttle pass, hit the mall, I got double cash, copped the duffle bag
Ten bands on my fuckin' ass, that's a subtle brag
High Level, we be makin' moves, hit the huddle fast, ah
Break the huddle, get a sack, that's a fumble on the play
Not in my house, he look like Mutombo in the face
Leave him spinnin' like a funnel cloud with lightning and some thunder
Like the Wizard of O-Z, the way we carry him away  (Uh)
Carry him, then bury him, barbarian
Beef with anybody, even if you vegetarian
My flow on ebola, your flow just need Claritin

689,252542,Don’t Front,Eminem,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, 
the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
‘Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the ""dope""
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
‘Cause those were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
‘Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front [Chorus: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say ""Bon appétit""
‘Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' ""Who the fuck passed you the mic?""
Never asked you to like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
‘Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock, almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
‘Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front [Chorus: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, ‘cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
‘Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, 
and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius—Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't ma
ke it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words
 that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's as mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned, hah
Bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words [Outro: Buckshot &

Don't just go hit 'em 'cause I gotta drive you
Focus on aimin' that blick at his dome!"" No cap
You motherfuckers be lucky as fuck that ain't nobody envious of you enough

Then he just gets spat back out again into a world where he doubled what he did

Minus a nine from ten, Eminem's spot still sits
But fuck a position, I'm tunin' him in
Let all you rock out with it, I ain't ever gonna be an opt-out mission
Get the Glock out with it, get to poppin', dip out and smoke
With the homies we mobbin', while I'm cleanin' the stash of my calibers
Some of them might got ya' name on 'em
While I brag about shit that could happen
I am the reason that they got a chain on 'em
When I rap, they consider me a Gatling
Fillin' up mags, I'm finna go clap 'em
Gettin' that bag with the G.O.A.T, B-Rabbit, I know they hate this flow
I'm in the mode to get to killin' again with the best
Stick in your dome, you're never gettin' a penny or less
Stealin' the flows, then I'ma spit it again as a test
Sick of these hoes, they get to bitchin' the bigger the breast
Nevertheless I'ma get it in a way that you can never better
Instead of settin' a bet up, I let up with the Beretta

My skin color's still working against me (What) 'cause second I should be to none
Being white ain't why they put me at five (Nope) it's why they can't put me at one (Whoot)

All the envious rappers I'd torch if I'm on a joint with 'em
And that is the only retort is I'm not played in the clubs motherfucker put a cork in it
Only reason they still play your shit in the clubs (Why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em (Haha)

Bitch you ain't been on this planet long enough to tell me how rap's supposed to sound
Ya'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds
In your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town
Shout to the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash but boy (What up doe)
There's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid
And I'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like half destroyed
Like a meteor hit it well there went Melle Mel we lost his ass to roids (Damn)
God was like ""I got him"" but I'm gonna start him at the bottom of the barrel brought him in the world
With a ma that was on valium and his father was a coward taught him as a child when no fucking body was around

[Verse 1]
The money speakin' for itself, I call it fortune-tell
Fire top from a bitch that work at corporate sales
Chinchilla ushanka, we skiin' out in Courchevel
Breakin' news, they tried to kill him, but the boy prevails
I leave for tour and my niggas fuckin' go to jail
Preachin' to the dogs 'bout wantin' more for themselves
It's weighin' heavy on my moral scale
Knowin' they gon' sell another citizen 'caine, they think they Orson Welles
Walk in Chanel, they like, ""How the fuck you need more Chanel?""
I got these cats tuckin' tails on fourth-quarter sales
I'm used to seein' tears drop over enormous meals
The restaurant clears out, faint echoes of
 
Lauryn Hill
I say, ""We gotta talk about us,"" I feel like Jordan Peele
Could tell I'm gettin' under your skin like a orange peel
'Cause your words don't match your actions like a foreign film
And now it's silence in the Lamb' like the horror film
Things get quiet after me statin' the obvious
Things get kinky after fifteen years of dominance
That October sky is lookin' ominous
The money is autonomous
Shout' to Oliver North, he out in Rome doin' Toronto shit
And Jeremiah the watchdog, you niggas know what time it is
I'm in and out of Houston Hobby so much, I'm a hobbyist
Hoes waitin' on Cench in the lobby, that boy a lobbyist
Savage got a green card straight out of the consulate
Where I go, you go, brother, we Yugoslavian
Formal is the dress code, dawg, so many checks owed
I feel Czechoslovakian, nigga, what the fuck? [Interlude]
Nah, I'm movin' different right now, for real, like
I feel like if Mike switched out the glove for the pen, like
This shit just too enticing right now, you know?
Look
[Verse 2]
Diamonds do the silly dance, I raise up the wine glass
Metal detectors beepin' and security bypass
The numbers goin' up, someone pull up the line graph
The days are goin' by, it's like I'm livin' in time-lapse
Been talkin' to Adel like he majored in finance
Shania Twain, notepad, I'm makin' it line-dance
You tryna rob me, and it's gon' feel like you sittin' at your favorite restaurant 'cause, nigga, that's where you dyin' at
Mob ties, I swear we like a bitch with fine sisters and fine cousins, the family all bad
I'm preachin' to the dawgs about cleanin' they images
I swear I'm like a young T.D. Jakes to my menaces
Long-kiss goodnight, PDA for my nemesis
Three hunnid acres, PGA on the premises
That's what's really brackin' like this verse in parentheses
I'm givin' hits to niggas on some, don't even mention it
[Interlude]
Like, don't even worry about it, like
You can hit me back whenever, or
Or don't, you know?
It is what it is, I guess
Yeah, hm
Look [Verse 3]
You young boys take some of that money and set it aside
Not havin' enough to pay your tax is a federal crime
You niggas obsessed with me, and it's not on no hetero vibe
Handle beef so quiet, you think that I'm lettin' it slide
Next thing you know, we tip-toein' past enemy lines
Diss me so long ago, we making your memories fly
Conspiracy theories start floatin' 'round like the Kennedy guy
I'll prolly hold a grudge against you guys 'til I'm seventy-five
Ayy, niggas lyin' for a livin', I couldn't relate
We all gotta lay in the bed we make, but that couldn't be Drake
You forced a lot of fake love when real ones stood in your face
That's why you got deserted by your niggas like puddin' and cake
I got you on camera bowin' down, but the footage is safe
Thank God, another USB to put in the safe
Thank God, at the crib, dippin' my foot in the lake
I swear that y'all turned me into the villain, I couldn't escape
Not sayin' I'm the best at what I do
I'm just sayin' that it's me versus whoever wanna lose
Pick any one of the Who's Whos, I got .22s for new crews
R.I.P. to the DJ from Houston, we loose screws
Helicopters, cop lights, and news crews
Niggas steady cryin' to my daddy, well, boo-hoo

Volkswagen shit the way I'm runnin' Beatles plays
Yeah, and we linkin' like we freed the slaves
I conquered hell, I walkеd the 'Ville and set my feet ablazе
My heart hardens every year like sneakers that Adidas made
I never did the VMAs, I'm not in need of praise
All praise to the born sinners Jesus saves
My brothers runnin' through the 6ix like the Green Berets
Beefin' with a block that's five hundred feet away
Wheel of Fortune shit the way they say they need a K
Nah, uh, I only need a raise
And a safe to stash these Frito Lays
Times was hard, I watched my mama robbin' Paul just to get Peter paid
And now my paper folded like when teachers don't want classmates to see your grade
Time is speedin' now, I see the greys pokin' out this beard, but it's weird 'cause I feel like I ain't even age

Bought this nigga jewels, these shits is light, let's get it reappraised
I bet you see the price and you gon' be amazed

And 21 my nigga like he celebratin' legal age
Next time I get in ROSALÍA face
I hope she tell her people that we need some space
Niggas think I won't get 'em hit, but like an Indian marriage, it could be arranged
Diss me and just may see us on your block like the street parade
At the top playin' keep-away with the crown
Our life's an open book, come and read a page
Drake pulled a white bitch that's goin' both ways, she like the queen of spades
I'm startin' to think they Percs is fake, they weed is laced
For thinkin' it's a game, if it's a game, these streets would be Bushido's Blade
Razor to his face and he ain't need a shave
I stay out of beef, seen niggas' DNA get rearranged
I'm with Drizzy in Atlanta, so many hitters with that nigga, they could be the Braves

May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
June have you movin' ice cold, goin' back and forth with a married man
July, that's when I found out you lied
August, it was ""baby"" this, ""baby"" that like you had your tubes tied
September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over
November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single
December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year
Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you
Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news
Get a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu
Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon
All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom
All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food
Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?
Seven bodyguards just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about [Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah
[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah [Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

Let's break it down, I’ll take the story from the slammin' of the door
Thought it was perfect for a second, guess you weren't quite as sure
Maybe I’m a little hard to get, maybe you didn't have the patience
Let's assess the situation
That girl was biding her time, yeah, she was waiting on your cue
So, somehow, I'm not surprised to see her standin' there with you
Maybe she's a little overdressed and I can see the smile you're fakin'
And the deep breath you’re takin’
[Pre-Chorus]
When you see me now, you're not lookin’ at her
Yeah, it's a long way down from the bridges you burned
Might wanna sit down, I'm calling you out
Right now
[Chorus]
You're a heartbreaker and she’s a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen
[Verse 2]
As I was saying, I was never quite a fan of little games
It doesn't take too long to see that boys like you are all the same
Maybe I'm a little less obsessed, but she's impressed
And I should mention, she's starving for attention [Pre-Chorus]
I can see it now, how it's all gonna be
When she freaks out, you'll be thinkin' of me
'Cause what went down is coming back around
You'll see
[Chorus]
'Cause you're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen
[Bridge]
Sometimes you get just what you see
Like, you chose her when you could've had me
Everything's a mess now, watch her little meltdown
Wish you both success and I hope you're happy
[Chorus]
'Cause you're a heartbreaker, she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama
Heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
[Chorus]
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations [Chorus]
Oh, my, love is a lie

Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)
[Bridge]
I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl [Verse 3]
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away
[Chorus]
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different 'cause it's you

Oh, my, love is a lie

Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?
[Pre-Chorus]
Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
It ain't what you and I are at all
[Chorus]
Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, ""I won't let you go""
I won't leave, it's a need

Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else
You forgot about me

Passion is a passing thing

Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving
This is like breathing for me [Chorus]

Touch me, hold me, tell me, ""I won't let you go""

Fading into madness

You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you
[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now [Chorus]

We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together

When you told me we'd get back together
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
Can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
Can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like we coachin' Wembanyama

Hope
Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm comin'
Don't
Don't lose faith in me
I know you've been waiting
I know you've been prayin' for my soul
Hope
Hope
Thirty years you been draggin' your feet, tellin' me I'm the reason we're stagnant
Thirty years you've been claiming you're honest and promising progress, well, where's it at?
I don't want you to feel like a failure
I know this hurts
But I gave you your chance to deliver
Now it's my turn
Don't get me wrong
Nate, you've had a great run
But it's time to
Give the people somethin' different
So without furthеr ado, I'd
Like to introduce my
My album (My album)
My album (My album), my album
My album (My album), my album (My album), my album (My album)
My album—
HOPE [Verse 1]
What's my definition of succеss? (Of success)
Listening to what your heart says (Your heart says)
Standing up for what you know is (Is)
Right, while everybody else is (Is)
Tucking their tail between their legs (Okay)
What's my definition of success? (Of success)
Creating something no one else can (Else can)
Being brave enough to dream big (Big)
Grinding when you're told to just quit (Quit)
Giving more when you got nothing left (Left)
It's a person that'll take a chance on
Something they were told could never happen
It's a person that can see the bright side
Through the dark times when there ain't one
It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'
Ain't afraid to walk away from
More profit 'cause they'd rather do somethin'
That they really love and take the pay cut
It's a person that would never waver
Or change who they are
Just to try and gain some credibility
So they could feel accepted by a stranger
It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation
It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazin'
What a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you
Why would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?
I done did things that I regret, I done said things I can't take back
Was a lost soul at a crossroad who had no hope, but I changed that
I spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred
Years of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from
Years of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation
Years of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in—
They get it [Verse 2]
Growing pain's a necessary evil
Difficult to go through, yes, but beneficial
Some would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing
Which on one hand, I agree with
On the other hand, it was the push I needed
To get help and start the healing process, see if
I'd have never hit rock bottom, would I be the person that I am today? I don't believe so
I'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons
Took me thirty years to realize that if you wanna get that opportunity 
to be the
Greatest version of yourself, sometimes you got to be someone you're not
 
to hear the voice of reason
Having kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror, at least for me, that's what it did, I
[Part II]
[Outro]
Wake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms and let him know he's loved (Loved)
Standing by the window, questioning if Dad is ever going to show up (Up)
Isn't something he's gon' have to worry 'bout, don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot
Mama, I forgive you, 
I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough
Thirty years of running, thirty years of searchin'
Thirty years of hurting, thirty years of pain
Thirty years of fearful, thirty years of anger
Thirty years of empty, thirty years of shame
Thirty years of broken, thirty years of anguish
Thirty years of hopeless, thirty years of (Hey)
Thirty years of never, thirty years of maybe
Thirty years of later, 
thirty years of fake
Thirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow
Thirty years of darkness, thirty years of (Nate)
Thirty years of baggage, thirty years of sadness
Thirty years of stagnant, thirty years of chains
Thirty years of anxious, thirty years of suffering
Thirty years of torment, thirty years of (Wait)
Thirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely
Thirty years of pushing everyone away ('Way)
(You'll never evolve) I know I can change
(We are not enough) We are not the same
(You don't have the heart) You don't have the strength
(You don't have the will) You don't have the faith
(You'll never be loved, you'll never be safe)
(Might as well give up) Not running away
(You don't have the guts) You're the one afraid

I really couldn't make it out, so I took the crazy route
That's one thing about me
Niggas can't get a thing about me
Motherfucker, gotta like bail around, you gotta bring the uh about me

Life ain't what it seems
So hard in this cruel world
Escaping through the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Aw, I only cry, smoking all the blunts in the house
I'll be wondering, I'll be wondering
It's been you and I, up and down commentary aisle
I'll be wondering, I'll be wondering
Get your shit off my lawn, I'll be running on the property lines
I'll be wondering, I'll be wondering
[Verse 1: Travis Scott & 
Justin Vernon

Tears dripping on my pillow, thoughts is in my head
See my dreams jump out my window, if I follow I'll be dead
And I been waiting all week to talk this shit but instead
Gon' have to burn this roof down for these niggas to understand
And what we fucking for? For the lights in thе night
The way yours eyes glow, you makе me want to have your sight
Damn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols
I survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner
But you can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga
I mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink
And she don't want to dance unless she drink (
I'll be wondering
)
Will this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?
Bookmarked a lot haters, I added more links
Rolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E
Wonder why I see the stars in the afternoon
Floating at night when you can catch me right under the moon [Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Aw, I only cry, smoking all the blunts in the house
I'll be wondering, I'll be wondering
It's been you and I, up and down commentary aisle
I'll be wondering, I'll be wondering
Get your shit off my lawn, I'll be running on the property lines
I'll be wondering, I'll be wondering
I won't cape, I [?] hard-hard lines
I been wondering
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
It's been a hell of a night, ain't it? Dim the lights, damn it
Feel the feel they get in this world, thought only the night'd save me
Swear that we came in peace; fed me lies, baby
On this morning flight, you the only thing on my mind
Feel the pain in this bass
We only wanna dress vintage to show up fashionably late
And after we fight, you only wanna come straight to the bed
And start unpacking your shit
And then you take up a line, that's that irrational shit
Around the globe, doing laps, I fill my pockets
Just watch me and my code, with a skinny killer nigga, who gon' stop me?
Besides, I never left, I wonder if did it this way, would I left her?
We get them suit and ties, baby, come on and let's rock
I feel my ties in the day
Sometimes I'm thinking 'bout reaching back in that plate
This one for my niggas that be dying in the maze
La Flame speak the gospel, let us pray [Bridge: Justin Vernon]
I been wondering

I just wanna spread my wings
Life ain't what it seems (Whey-yo)

Relationships are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over and I could go for
Another chance to do this over again

So this is it? After all we've been through
We called it quits and now I'm about to
I've lost my grip or what little I had left
You said it's over and I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me, you'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose

I pop these pills like Cracker Jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes just watching you react
When you're depressed, you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up [Pre-Chorus]

We proclaim we're all the same
But is that truе in every way?
Peoplе dying every day
People fading into nothingness [Verse]
We ain't nothing like they say
Till when we're gonna take
The words and phrases they spend
So much time trying to educate?
[Pre-Chorus]
We go 'round to every single place
We're being always stepped all over
They believe it's just a phase
To me, we were born this way
[Chorus]
You scream, I shout, we all yell
Think they've heard but that's not the case
The state of the world we're in
There's nothing you can do about it

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us (I know, I know) [Spoken]
We're here, taking a stand
Against the dictatorship of Qatar
And just send our love and solidarity
To Qatari women, LGBTs, immigrant workers
We are all on your side
We also wanna send a message to FIFA

Basically, what they say is a lie
Spread like a disease to infect the minds
Of those who are born into a world
Full of shit promoted as the Holy Word
This violence needs to end
We've got the power in our hands
We must stop all this hate
Turn it into love, it's the only way

We go around to every single place
We're always being stepped all over
They believe it's just a phase
To me, we were born this way

 (Logic)
Yeah, check it, ayo
[Verse]
Pick up the brush like Picasso, '93 Nas flow
200 on the 101, watch as the nos go (Now)
Straight from the underground, that lost flow
Now we get Louis V, back in the day as a kid it was Costco
I stay breaded like Roscoe’s
Rap messiah, me and my apostles
I'm 33 but by rap years I'm fuckin’ fossils
Still kickin', still pushin', still grindin', still goin'
Already knowing that I don't know shit
Walk in the room, knew my intentions ‘fore I spoke it
I took the record and broke it
Feeling limitless, I'm feeling so focused
This is all me, nobody co-wrote this
And I hope this reach you when you need it
Not at your wit's end, feeling depletеd
Keep being you, fake motherfuckеrs we seeing through
This some rap shit, come now feel the flow in this beat
I’ve had my ups and downs, but life ain’t ever felt this steep
Shallow moments in my career, but it's never been this deep
Praise God that I’m alive, moment I wait 'til I see
Ayo, this is emceeing, finally ON-YO like Koreans
Foreseeing I would blow like C4, who want more?
Me and my clique tighter than belt buckles
This for anybody that life beat down and felt knuckles
For the Discord, pulling strings like Hendrix's ripcords
(You are watching a master at work)
Wooh, this shit crazy (Is this what you want?) [Verse 2]
Ayo, my kicks 3G's like an astronaut’s, pass the shots
You stay acting funny
Need a reality check? That's that Kardashian money
My flow ultra, no 85
'86 you like Reagan, no longer alive
Engaging in bullshit, I want no parts
Rapping in my genes, ain't no starch
I can rhyme without rhyming
, still make the people third month
Fifth month I continue to ensue, cut you like Ginsu
You don't know the shit that I been through
It's hard to stay present when your past was tense
The flow is immense
Weed hit my chest like 450 on the bench
On my 
MPC2000XL
 in the front yard
I stay with vintage brakes like junk yards, always come hard
Pick up the mic now En Garde
Try hard, back with another attempt
Don't hold me exempt
Stay with bars like I was held in contempt
Ain't fucking with you like a women ain't giving consent
What's the gift of life without presents?
Smoking an ounce plus the resin
I got the throne, you got the chair
Stay dropping the ball like Time Square
When I'm fried I lose track of time like Phil in Futurama
No time for the drama, only the comma, my money never pause
Rebel with a cause
, sound the applause
In the cut like gause
Black and white like Hitchcock
, me and the blunt lip-lock
I'ma 
kick push
, you can suck a dick and then kick rocks [Outro]

Ain't belong, no love lost
Good always will win [Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fightin' (Fightin')
I don't feel I've lost (Feel I've)
Am I dreamin'? (Dreamin')
Is there more like us?
 (More like)
Got me feelin' (Feelin')
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten (Beaten)
But I can't give up (Can't give)
I'm still fightin'
I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'?
Is there more like us?
Got me feelin'
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten
But I can't give up (Can't give)

Up
Can't give, can't give
Up
Can't give, can't give
Up
Can't give, can't give
Up
Can't give up"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud
Every little thing that I think about
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt
Even though I wanna just let it out
I try to act like I don't mind it, try to keep my mouth so quiet
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better 
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever 
(siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
But every time I think I got everything put back together 
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily 
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me 
(siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
Now I don't know how it overflowed, spilled out unwillingly 
(ti stnaw eno oN)
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better 
(ti stnaw eno oN)
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever 
(siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
And every time you think you got everything put back together 
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose

I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside me
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly 
inside of me

Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (
This is how I feel
)
I'm trapped in yesterday (
Just a memory
)
Where the pain is all I know (
This is all I know
)
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
]
And I'll never break away (
Can't break free
)
'Cause when I'm alone
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
]
But I'm tired, I will always be afraid
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (
This is all I know
)
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
]
I will never break away (
Can't break free
)
'Cause when I'm alone [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright (I'm lost)
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright (I'm lost)
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion"

13474,8484262,VALUES,Justin Timberlake,"[Verse]
Idiosyncrasy, we cancel it
Due to a lack of empathy
See the other as the enemy
We must kill to feel free
We're told again and again
We must crush the other's head
[Pre-Chorus]
So we can know what victory is
Don't you think that's insane? Isn't it?
[Chorus]
It's a culture of hiding
It's a culture of lying
All for just our sake
All to just save some face
It's a culture of hiding
It's a culture of lying
All for just our sake
All to just save some face
[Verse]
Don't need a mirror or a sun
To know what happens
I don't want a filter
Nor rose-coloured glasses (rose-coloured glasses)
Don't need tabloids
To tell what's real and what's not
I don't really mind
I don't follow bots (I don't follow bots) [Pre-Chorus]
Guess I'm getting tired, tired of this world
Guess I'm so much better, better off (better off)
Guess I don't need luxuries (luxuries)
To know who I am, so I am free (woo!)
[Chorus]
It's a culture of hiding
It's a culture of lying
All for just our sake
All to just save some face
It's a culture of hiding
It's a culture of lying
All for just our sake
All to just save some face (breakdown)
[Bridge]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema, yo'
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreading love, we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity (from unity)
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found [Chorus]
It's a culture of hiding (it's a culture of hiding)
It's a culture of lying (it's a culture of lying)
All for just our sake
All to just save some face (save some face)
It's a culture of hiding  (it's a culture of hiding)
It's a culture of lying (it's a culture of lying)
All for just our sake
All to just save some face
[Outro]
(Save some face, face, face)
(Save some face, face, face)
(Save some face, face, face)
(Save some face, face, face)
(No, no, no)
Or fancy cars to be who I am
Guess you've been brainwashed
Well I ain't no genius boy
But I'm trying not to watch
What you see on that box"
