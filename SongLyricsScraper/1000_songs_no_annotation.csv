7426,3681512,Ye vs. the People (starring TI as the People),Kanye West,"[Intro: Four Tops]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
[Verse: Kanye West & 
T.I.
]
I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit…
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, ""Fuck it, I'ma do me.""
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it [Outro: Kanye West]
Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?"

Shawty know I'm trappin' pounds, nigga, blow it down
Bust it open, I got paper, what you playin' for?
And that pussy, I'ma pound it
She want a young rich nigga got so many racks, can't count it
Trap pounds, trap pounds, I serve all around
When I come to your town I'ma lay it down
Got a bitch on a bitch, and I want to know about
She spit on the dick

Pop a perc, can you feel it?

We talkin' pound after the pound
Pound after the pound

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Pound after pound, I take a fade in it
She told me, ""Don't stop,"" so I stay in it
""Ain't no nigga been this deep,"" that's what she told me
When we're done all you wanna do is hold me
I ain't finished, from the kitchen to the bed
You gon' have to keep up with me
I don't mind if you stay
But you're gon' have to wait up for me
Do you feel it, baby? Can you feel it?
Shot after shot got us faded
Girl you look amazing when you're naked
Stop playin' with it, come give it to me [Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Ty Dolla $ign]
Five in the A.M., pourin' these shots of wine
No parents allowed, turn off the stars and the clouds
We smoke and foggin' around
Phone calls go straight to the pound
We talkin' pound after...
We talkin' pound after the pound
Pound after the pound
Pound after the pound"

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you [Bridge]

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months, you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
[Chorus]
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right
[Verse 2]
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes [Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
[Chorus]
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right
[Bridge]
And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
[Chorus]
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right [Outro]
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"

I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like ""nah"" [Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know [Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, ""Alright, alright, alright""
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, ""Babe, I think I love you, kinda""
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, word"

Got a darkskin girl, 5' 8"" with the brown eyes
We been up and down, had a couple crashes but she still ride
She go to school, got two jobs, drive the same Kia 'cause it still slide
Work so hard on her off day, she be still tired
I just wanna take away the pain
I just wanna put you up on game
I just wanna help you make you better, wish you would've never gave it to that lame
Even if we do our own thang, the bond we got can't be explained
Girl, I'm just speakin' for future reference (
Oh, oh
), 'cause I understand feelings change (
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

You're my little secret (Secret)
That's how we should keep it (How we should keep it)
We should never let it go, never let it show
You're my, you're my, oh yeah
[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
I don't care what these hoes think that they got goin' on
I've been here day one, I know what's goin' on
You ain't gotta try to tell me, like I know my place
I never went too far, I always find my way, back to you
Ain't no way I could lose you
Sometimes it's just things in life just worth keepin'
Why we ain't creepin'?
I'm just your little secret
That's how we should keep it, yeah, babe

You're my little secret (Secret)

Hope you been thinking 'bout me
'Cause I been thinking 'bout you
Girl, I'm tryna make you my wife
I done told the thots, ""I'm through""
If you ever leave my side, I'ma probably lose my cool
We was in high school and your friends said that it won't work
From the sixth grade to the ninth grade, she did my homework
Put my pistol in your book bag, you ain't even own a purse
You done held me down from the jumpstart, you deserve a verse
You my little secret (You my little secret)
That's how we gon' keep it (That's how we gon' keep it)
Got done gamblin', feelin' like Michael, now I'm finna beat it

552,6286323,Alfred’s Theme,Eminem,"[Verse 1]
Before I check the mic (Check, check, one, two)
I give it a extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (Good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (Yeah) give zero fucks, then I (Yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (Uh), cup my nuts, then I (Yeah)
Check my ball hair (What?), make sure it's all there (Yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (Yeah)
It's 
Music to Bе Murdered By
 again, why stop?
Overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I (Only one eye) got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like *snores*
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands [Interlude]
Shit, hold on, man
Motherfuck
Happy birthday to—
Fuck (Shh, quiet)
[Verse 2]
I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch
[Interlude]
What the fuck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch?""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch
[Verse 3]
So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)
From the 
MMLP
 to (Huh?) 
MTBMB

Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)
So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)
Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)
My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)
Dukes of Hazzard
 car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy her designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)
And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)
Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole [Outro]
Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
Fuck it"

How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot) [Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left, I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga [Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)

Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look
[Verse]
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, ""True, though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a ""Respectfully,"" I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation
?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin'
, dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' ""Bro,"" but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, ""Boy, you're going places""
Never understood where I could really take it [Outro]

I am a lonely soul, I assure you
If you want, my dear, I assure you
If you want, my dear, I assure you
If you want, my dear, I assure you
[Chorus: Ab-Soul & SZA]
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone (You gotta think for yourself, this is it)
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I'm conflicted to my amazement, I'm just amazed
Slim, silver spoon in my mouth
Spoiled little Carson kid with chandelier up in my shed
Future's looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
Uh, cause Punch told me to punch him in the face
Make a statement, lead slaves to salvation with my way with words
I kept the Soul in the alphabet
The alpha-male in my era
, 
I'm here to baffle them like the Baphomet
They ain't know what the cover of my second album meant
I'm in the booth if I'm asking you where the bathroom at
Before the whole wide world eye balled Top Dawg
They wouldn't even give this cat a rack to perform
Sure Lori was more than empathetic
But the seven hundred I got took her to Lawry's instead of IHOP
My high-school sweetheart turned my ticker so bitter
Still staying strong for Ray, CJ, and all our little sisters
Vaneesha just had Jaleel, that's my third nephew
Cory's adorable and Cody still missed you
All my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
If you was Nuit you would know what I mean (Nuit!)
Hundred proof Absolut in the back of your Acura
Donny Hathaway on repeat
My mentor asked me ""what happens after Control System?""
Wanted to tell him ""the system controls me,"" please [Chorus: Ab-Soul & SZA]
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone

They can't hate, they don't want
They can't take it
Long lost member of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Getting high with a little bit of help from my friends
The rifles to my rivals all my homies got a homie
That bodied one of my homies, yo that cycle is psycho
A coward killed my brother Jorgiano and his momma
And I'm complaining about a album, what is my problem?
[Interlude: Punch]
Soulo, you know God was alone for eternity?
Yet he wasn't lonely
You gotta love, love is create
Create, create [Verse 3: Punch]
They shot Mirelli Pervis in the face
He survived due to God's grace
Ironically him and my uncle share the same birthday
Is it fate or is it faith?
I just might be in your hood still
Lonely soul itching for a love that I've once known but I've outgrown it
I told Famous be patient, I'm in the hills
While this world is caving in and I'm living a vacation
Or so it seems, to the wig it's all in
Won't hesitate to find a coffin to make these niggas crawl in
I tried to stall him but I ain't have no alternative
I told him to think smart, he told me get it how I live
Point taken, Lord, why have you forsaken us?
Blasting at Satan for salvation, feels Pagan
Graced in the Land of Canaan
But my new world translation speaks of a different arrangement
When Death meets death, eternal breath fills my lungs
Death forever paid in the name of God's son
Currently wasting away in this wicked system
Scared to pray for forgiveness cause I ain't sure if I repent it
Oh what an existence
In fact is this really living?
Drowning in my own expenses
While tryna make Soul listen to my infinite wisdom [Outro: Ab-Soul & SZA]
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
I said leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone

Crack the windows and take the shutters down and carry on, carry on
Take just one seed and put it in the ground and move along, move along

And every time I leave, you know you miss it
Don't be crying on my shoulder every time I'm coming over

Now I got her ass calling all the time
And I wish I never met her, Carl Thom'
Driving down my street like it's the Autobahn
Getting loud, setting off the car alarms
Here put on my chain, baby you need to chill
Give it some time, baby, let it rebuild
Quit running your nose through the Beverly Hills [Chorus: Playboi Carti]

I been playing a bet from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"" [Chorus: Chris Martin]

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town [Chorus: Chris Martin]

Tell your parliament, ""Pardon me"" (Woo)
Off the saké, turned to Socrates (Woo)
Heavy moments on the ground
Feel it shapin' in the sound
'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house
And you know that we down
If yo' ass don't know nothin'
Gotta know that it's time
I'm excited to jump in
So much that I'm flyin'
Put you right in the function
Took you right off a vine
Got this shit in a bind
We got it, we got it now (
Ah, woo
)
Whenever I'm duckin' it (
Ah, woo
) [Outro: The Weeknd]
I'm waiting on a let go
I'm waiting on a let go
I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special
Go, collect your fame
I'm waiting in an echo
I'm waiting in an echo
'Cause you keep callin' back, I thought I told you that we do not
Sorry, I didn't let you out
Out, woah-oh
(Out)
(Out, woah-oh)"
12321,3050773,Take It Back,Logic,"[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
""Fuck it, I’ma steal this land""
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
""Fuck it, I’ma steal this land""
[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not
""You ain't black, you a mothafuckin' white boy
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, a'ight boy?
Man, why you such a hype boy?""
""Why you always talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck that""
Everything you talk about, cut that
That door you trying to open, you could shut that
Grip the gat, yeah that’s how I’ma buck back
Tell me what I am and what I know now
All this prejudice has got to go
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down
Come and see me when I am in yo' town
Practice what we preach before it go down
Practice what we preach before it go
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?
Masta deep down inside of me
The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat? [Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back

[Outro]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nig
ger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other"
1159,4998091,Things Get Worse (Lost Version),Eminem,"[Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just ""How far will this go?""
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better
[Verse 1]
Holy Toledo, it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me ""Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat,""
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don’t mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
'Cause I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krueger
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer
, get the lubra-
Cation 
and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cause... [Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just ""How far will this go?""
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better
[Verse 2]
I guess for him to stop is impossible
He just picked up another prostitute in the parking lot of the hospital
And beat her over the head mercilessly and left her for dead
He thought she was, 'cause otherwise he would never have left
Miraculously, she survived the attack
Even after his accuracy after he hacked the pussy with an axe
What are the odds that she'd be back?
He grabbed his encyclopedia off of the top of his fucking CD rack
Hit her with that then he threw her into the TV, ah!
I'm not playing, Rihanna, where'd you get the VD at?
Motherfuck the media! I'm reading ya something strictly from me to ya
Straight off the paper and this one's a freebie Jack
Let me add my two cents, of course I side with Chris Brown
I'd beat a bitch down too if she gave my dick an itch, now
It's just ridiculous how much this kind of sit-ow-
Ation can make her stink, how much gangster shit can he dish out? [Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just ""How far will this go?""
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t, can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya

Man, when are you gonna let up?

[Verse 3]
Oh my gosh, I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer!
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael'd like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a motherfucking icicle, I'm a nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post-traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(He can’t say whore!) Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties [Chorus]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just ""How far will this go?""
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up

[Speech]
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety"

To beat that case against them odds
Against them guys with your last bit of money for your lawyer

'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here

Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang [Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Good goodbye
Good goodbye

At a coffee shop on 8th
Or maybe it was in my mind
And I swear that I heard your laugh
From a person that walked past me
At a party the other night

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true [Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and 
blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

You remind me of home

Where the weather is warm
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long [Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long [Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, two cups,
 hold up, hold up
I'm headed to the moon 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco
, 
piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and I'm doing my dance
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all [Guitar Solo]

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me

But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me
, 
I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could 
check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an 
A-list
 rapper
I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"" [Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (
Los Angeles
)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money!)
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker! [Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla—, pla—, pla—

1138,3280,The Kids,Eminem,"[Intro]
And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that 
(Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!
[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping block (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you [Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (You can ask)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom
 (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
 (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?
[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut! (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you [Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Right on)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?
[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swole up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at
 (Eh?)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you [Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?
[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! 
(Shut up!)
Sing along, children! 
(Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad 
(
South Park
 is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me 
(Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
(Uh, the fart button's on) (*
fart
*) (Ew, ahh!)
La la la (So fucked up right now)"

If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins, on the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God, it
Feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow

But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else

But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & 
Kendrick Lamar
]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(
Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga, oh
)
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
And we don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what it said to me
But the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him, nah [Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going? 
Why are we slow
ing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight [Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer"

Put that into what's worth having (boy) [Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan
[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man) [Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then

Yeah, 
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places
I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like
[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like?
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it [Chorus]
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like

She said she never liked you from the start

But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man

Is it in your genes? I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way? [Pre-Chorus]

Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't

I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath

""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn""
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And, by the way, where's my dad? [Chorus]
Father, please, forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black; well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that;
 
why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
""What was me, there goes poor Marshall, again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion, and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it: that little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it""
Man, if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...
Haha [Chorus]
Father, please, forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please, release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please, believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say ""I'm sorry""
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know, but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So, please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone [Chorus]
Father, please, forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
[Chorus]
I said, ""Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds""
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

Take a bow, think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?
[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave? [Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it [Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me"

Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad [Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it, beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it, ha, ha, ha, ha)

No one wants to be defeated (Oh, lord)
Showin' how funky (Hee-hee!) and strong is your fight (Hee-hee-hee!)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it (Beat it!)
No one wants to be defeated (Oh-no!)
Showin' how funky (Hoo-hoo!) and strong is your fight (Hee-hee! Hoo!)

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like Pacino in 
Godfather
, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven
, 
Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment,
 
broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital,
 
avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas
, 
do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back
[Chorus]
Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'ma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say ""what's your motivation?""
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy, fuck a vacation
We do this for love, not no validation [Pre-Chorus]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh

Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? 
I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it
—but fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, 
cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow (I know) [Pre-Chorus]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded

Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now

Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla [Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue

'Cause I tried to make this shit work
But it seems like you was in your feelings
You kept them hatin' bitches all in our business
But I just got one question, baby
Tell me why?

Started from the bottom like Drake said
You the type of nigga get robbed wanna play dead
My squad'll  kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari, games girl I don't play that
If she broke I don’t acknowledge her, everything I say I follow up
What you talkin' 'bout? Ummmm, Polo shirt, my collar up
Drippin' on these hoes
Ain't by myself, it's a lot of us
Made a little money, still ain't got enough
And if you got a nigga dead, put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open, don't say nothin'
Motor geeked up like a razor
You don't know me, you must mistake me
For somebody else
But it's somethin' about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga, fuck him
I had to tell her that [Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
I don't know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue

Yeah
I'm in the Missoni room at the Byblos
The boat was rockin' too much on some Aaliyah shit

We goin' from the Vava to Cinquante-Cinq, then back to the Vava
If you know, you know, baby, I don't, I don't know what to tell you
Yeah
Ayy
[Verse: Drake]
Look
Long way from Sette Mezzo
Meet Tommaso and Ernesto
Short rigatoni with the pesto
These verses are my manifesto
Hallways got an echo
Me and Smiggz on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go
Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""
The first martini is an espresso
Chill shot glasses with prosecco
Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they bе like, ""Why the fuck you makin' techno?""
I'm worldwidе and this is just another cargo jet flow, I had to let go
Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko
I got some meaner threats, though
Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow
I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo
I'm losin' track of where we all go
I wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo
Fifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo
Yeah
Fifty-nine bags on the—, ayy
Swedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk
For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus
Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us
We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up
I mean, these just my suggestions of course
EmRata here fresh off divorce
And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse
If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards
I'm here for the moral support
Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas
Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers
Drake, you got it
Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic
You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product
Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff
Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough
That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods
You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris
If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs
Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy
First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me
No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy
They underestimated my trajectory
But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me
I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—
Independent women is lovin' the new appearance
Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris
Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""
I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious
The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods
Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears
This shit designed for divine ears
My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""
And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers
Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years
And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear
Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy
Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie
Shout out TVGUCCI
, my cousin is spooky
I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie
Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie
He claim we don't got a problem but
No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi
We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki
Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake
They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me
I'm really on a roll like hamachi
The fuck would y'all really do without me?
For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi
Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee
And 
Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi
Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""
I really can't remember it properly
All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties
Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me
I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me
She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me
Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me
Need to be high-sixin' me
Swear niggas highkey sick of me
They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently
Feel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany
I'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me
They should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me [Outro: Birdman]
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
Million-dollar spot (Brr, brr)
That's how motherfuckers in CMB play it
Middle of the ocean (Blatt)
Just like that (Shine, shine)
All dark fresh green water
Land that thing
With 'bout a hundred hoes
We up and we livin' like that, boy
Fresh fly fish like, you understand me, like, real G shit
You hear me? A neighborhood superstar
It's bigger than anything
You know, we start from the bottom, then we come to the top
Get to the top and we stay up there
You hear me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)
We look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up
And we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)
Big Florida water, big water ocean
On that type of time
You understand me?
Rich nigga, rich life, you understand me?
Come from the bottom, but we come from the bottom (Rich life)
But we understand the bottom 'cause we come from it
And we live with it (You understand?)
Go to our grave 'bout this here, boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
5956,5879432,The Heart Part 5 (Original),Kendrick Lamar,"[Verse 1]
I was born on February 24th, 1970
The day I was delivered, they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing
I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac
So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged
My father was a public figure, bigger than life
Lived as a winner, on stages alike
Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond
Time carried on, that was a common thread
My perfect father had many flaws
Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison
He had more children, I was the oldest
We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em
He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings
Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school
The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed
I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news
Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused
I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose
See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued
They crucified my affiliation for points to prove
And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you
My total existence was for makin' a smiling move
They said that I'll live forever
But the moment he died, more accusations arrived
I had to die too [Verse 2]
I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963
The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV
My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief
How could a group of words be so great?
Designed to make you think
Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form
How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?
The person responsible, my creator
He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation
Watch him perform with conviction
Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen
I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission
His life became heroic, then tables turned
My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned
Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect
It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me
I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy
How many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?
I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job
I was only born to make sure your children can play outside
And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died
If they came to surface, this dream probably won't be alive
Because of you
[Verse 3]
I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us
We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck
The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up
The non-creators are now elated and out of touch
Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?
Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived
You want the head of the messenger and the history from him
Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom
Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'
The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in
The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice
Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?
Because your better judgement will always look down on me
But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me
I got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see
It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality
See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?
If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?
I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a God
Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art
Sincerely yours"

7209,5897,Say You Will,Kanye West,"As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes
Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi
If I go too fast down this road I end up like Left Eye
I’m wondering would it be better if I left life
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I’m gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone, looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her what she crying for
I’m so fresh I’m wondering ""why didn’t I design clothes?""
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they gon' make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean? No
Man please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils
(ahem) Shut up bitch swallow
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It’s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life dog it’s me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit
And I don’t mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's selfless
I’m feeling like a crab in a bucket
That’s just tryna get it crackin'
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish And it’s a dream come true that you signed me
Big Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee
People asking me how it happened, man I tell 'em
I Rolex-ed the situation and just had perfect timing
And you already know where to find me
Bitch I'm connected to the D like Siamese
So if you see me out of town getting money
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly
So say what up if you see us
And the D is burn rubber and the 
Sean man lead us
Like being undefeated, feeling undefeated
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus
Glad to do any interview or dope feature
Come holla at a nigga as I’m trying on sneakers
Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can’t be it
You are just a hundred-and-one percent bitch
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
And I don’t want fans, I want believers
Race to success so I'mma keep pedalin'
Cuz my mama man she deserve everything
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her
Then best believe she gon' get a wedding ring
But I don’t know if I believe in love to be honest
Cuz every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up
And that’s why girls wanna leave us
Tell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us
Won’t stop till we end up on that show Cheaters
But I bet you couldn’t spot me if a nigga wore cheetah
And I be in the strip-club Teasers
Giving all the girls what’s needed
Honest dog had so many problems dog
I could hand 'em out and be labeled a fuckin' teacher
So respect my hand gesture
I dare any nigga try and come test us
You a mothafuckin' act dog, a A.C.T. that’s why niggas try and test ya
A-Dub how the hell we gon' make a mil
Pay the bills man, I ain’t tryna waste a deal
If you could make a deal believe you could break a deal
And if you can’t keep your promises then don’t say you will

Oh, never leave me alone
Tell 'em holla at ya boy, 'cause I'll be comin' home
I'll be comin' home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell 'em holla at ya boy 'cause I'll be comin' home
I'll be coming—
[Interlude: Kanye West]
First of all, my name is Kanye to the...
I just wanna tell my story to all y'all
I just wanna see if you can figure out what I'm talking 'bout, okay?
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie called me like, ""What up, man?""
Not from Florida, but what up, fam?
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me, damn, what up then?
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and yo, I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
[Niggas] come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what [niggas] tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Shoot for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town [Chorus: John Legend & 
Kanye West

Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours [Chorus: Kanye West]

""Murder"" again

Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized

And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

And they say by 21, I was supposed to die

Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I ""shh-shh""
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours"

Feel like I'm 35 times my age
Look in the mirror don't know what to say
But I'm happy the man I is [Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I said I'm happy the man I is
And I'm proud of the man I've become
I'm proud that I'm from a slum
And never got cold, I never got numb
Except for the wintertime and then some
I transcend and I transform
Poetic vision in rare form
Growing up, nobody there for him
I promise when I have a family I'ma be there for 'em
I love hip-hop
Hatin' motherfucker, go kick rocks
No matter what happen I never gon' stop
Like Cole said, if they don't know yo' dreams
Then they can't shoot 'em down
But I'ma let the world know
'Cause I'm too high up to hit the ground
This shit right here is like therapy, spit it verily
I ain't perfect, I got problems, I got issues like People magazine
Shoot from the hip and reload the magazine
I wish I could just go on forever, forever, ever and ever
But this rhyme
Ill as it is divine
Gon' be cut short today 'cause I'm out of studio time
Only thought I was recording these horns and not no rhyme
What can I say? Inspiration hits at any time
So I guess I'll have to conclude all my thoughts another time
Another rhyme
Another— Ano— i— wo— a— rhyme [Outro: Thalia]

Ha! And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it

You come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, you still fuckin' real Drizzy

I figured out this world is ours for the taking
I figured out that when I go out and all those people scream
That's some of them are living vicariously through me
That's why I put that ""S"" on my chest and I'm gone
But on another note, let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg, 'cause you look pretty when you beggin'
So meet me on the campus, I'll be there around eleven

Excuse me if I look down (Down)

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official

And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double-cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix? Then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot

All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

Black drophead Phantom just to hog up all the lanes
If you don't think that's funny, then you don't know me, money
If you playin' 'bout this paper, then you don't know me, honey
The clique don't do no holsters, we standin' on the sofa
And we be in them Rolls, the ones that come with chauffeurs
Who the fuck the DJ? He playin' all my hits
Say who them niggas puttin' on? Bet they got all the bricks

Used to have the glass like it came out the backboard
Came in the backdoor, skin color rim
Man the bitch keep rubbin' on me, I'ma turn into a genie
Got that Magic City flow, got that money on the floor

Walkthrough the Rollie and bust down

I go jump in your bitch and then jump in a foreign
You know what I represent
Everything I whip up, yeah it gotta be foreign
We wrap it up like a mummy
Finessin' and wrappin' up dummy
I got a plug on the girl
But I know, I know you tellin'
I gotta shit on you first, cause I know you jealous
I had to jump off the porch, now I'm fully developed

STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter (Let's go)
I'ma run the compound (Yeah)
I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woo)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh-huh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra) [Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1"", on the money, 9'2""
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew
[Outro: Travis Scott]
I, crash down, we get money (Hey)
For the full town (Woah, when you won't play, I)
I decided, for the full side (Hoes will say)
And they know, I might (And fly, I...)
Get down, might (Don't play)
See the whole town every time, I... (Oh, every day)
Yeah, they know what's up (Folks will say)"

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?
[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning, learning, learning), I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
[Chorus]
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on [Post-Chorus]
Yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly my friends
[Chorus]
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah yeah

I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me
[Chorus: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, ""Ain't too much that's different""
I be shinin', they be shinin'
, 
get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission? [Chorus: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, ""If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white-out""
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive,
 and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'... [Chorus: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

Finally Famous in this, gettin'
E'rything
I say
[Verse]
I'm still dreaming bigger than I'm living
And just sleeping long enough to dream
Spent long enough in the sheets
It's time to turn it to the real thing
And turn these ideas to milli's, business into buildings
No girlfriend, you're looking for some feelings, find a dentist
Me and my crew toured around the world, shook a million hands
I never made the crowd fans, I made 'em all fam
And came back to the city that made us all men
Except we kings now, reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall I'm crowd surfing the map
I turn mistakes into lessons, dead ends to exits
On the journey of my life, so I'm inviting y'all to get in
Let's go

Go, go
Go, go, go, go"

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it
[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)
[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
Oh my [Chorus: Logic]
(Oh my) Oh my
(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Ohhh
Oh my, my, my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right deep inside
Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah
[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all

Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one
[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance"

Maybe it says somethin' about me (Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together
[Verse 1]
She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how— [Chorus]
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 9-1-1 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty?
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
To a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognized me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-Beep*)
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo

Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS

The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a

He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls [Chorus: Kid Cudi]

Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken,

Kickin' ass of us Africans,

Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines,

Secret society weapon,

Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, 
no Zion

And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean, I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA

My only job is cut the time in half
So at thirteen, we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'

7074,1465,Never Let Me Down,Kanye West,"[Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh baby
Hahahaha
Turn the motherfuckin' music up
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get down
[Over Chorus: Jay-Z]
That's right, it's what I do!
C'mon, uh-huh
Nah, you know I never let you down!
Gyeah, gyeah, yuh
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy [Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather
 
who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side [Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, 
that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church [Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down
[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(
Oh, yeah, we ain't finished
)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble
, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
 
(Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive"
9601,3219244,If You Want Love,NF,"[Verse 1]
I just need some time, I'm tryna think straight
I just need a moment in my own space
Ask me how I'm doin', I say ""okay,"" yeah
But ain't that what we all say?
Sometimes I think back to the old days
In the pointless conversations with the old me
Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me
I wish somebody woulda told me
[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love
[Verse 2]
Yeah, as a kid I used to think life
Is moving so slow, I watch it go by
Look out the window on my bus ride
I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes
I've always tried to control things
In the end that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'
I wish somebody woulda told me [Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love
[Verse 3]
The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time
Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right
I'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
And tell 'em
[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
I wish you woulda told me
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
I wish somebody woulda told me
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
You gon' have to give
If you want love, if you want love
If you want love, if you want love"
2272,3295229,Say It First,Sam Smith,"[Verse 1]
I never feel like this
I'm used to emptiness in my heart
And in my arms
You're not what I'm used to
You keep me guessin' with things that you do
I hope that they're true
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me? [Verse 2]
I know you're right for me
But I'm waiting for everything in your world
To align with my world
I think of you while I sleep
I dream of what we could be if we grow
Together unfold
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm never gonna heal my past
If I run every time it starts
So I need to know if I'm in this alone
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words
If I'm all that you desire, I promise there'll be fire
I need to hear you say it first
Come on, baby, do your worst
I know you'll take me higher
So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?

Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Come on, baby, say it first
I need to hear you say those words

So come on, darling
If you love me, say it first
Say it, say it, say it

Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?
Say it, say it, say it
Won't you say it to me?"

You wonder why I love you
There was never pressure
Easy as I want to
There's just no one better
You think it's calculated
Baby, I'm just not that clever, never
[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And what could I say?
I knew that it would go this way
Of course you blame it on fate (Fate)
Couldn't let it just escape
Now at the end of our days
I run back thoughts of you

Thoughts of you keep me up at night
Up at night, up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at night (Keep me up)
Up at night, up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at—
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I think about all of the ways you turn me on (Turn me on)
And my bed gets lonely whenever you're gonе (Whenever you'rе gone)
But, baby, I'm a wreck without you (You)
All I do is fantasize about you (About you)
You're the light of my life, yeah, I mean it
Girl, you got what I want when I need it
And even when the sun don't shine
I'll be right by your side, holdin' you tight (Holdin' you tight)
And when you feel like nobody cares
I'll be right there to remind you that [Chorus: Kehlani]
You keep me up at night (Keep me up)

9937,308994,Drowse,Queen,"[Verse 1]
It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed
Partings I recall
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays
[Chorus]
There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all
[Verse 2]
It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero, it all turns to zero [Chorus]
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small
[Bridge]
Out here on the street, we'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
And half of the time we'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did in the school hall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun
[Verse 3]
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all
[Outro]
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast, I guess
I think I'll be 
Clint Eastwood
Oh no, 
Jimi Hendrix
, he was good
Let's try 
William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?
Brian May"

I was rubbin' lotion on your body and your ass
Bought you a whole bunch of fly shit so you can brag
And when your friends talk about me, you be so mad
But, you know my body, girl, you know me
You know my body, girl, you know me
Yeah, yeah, you already felt it
And I already seen you naked
But girl don't make me re-up [Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
And I was just up in Starlet's, feel like a privilege now
Me and my boys so deep, no, we not sittin' down
Yeah, I was one side over, I had to hold you down
And me and Bubba the only niggas goin' round for round
[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
And this VV gang pull up in a lemon coupe
He got SI's in this chain, he mixin' up his jewels
And you done fucked on my gang, so I'm not lovin' you
You cannot fuck up my name, so I'm not cuffin' you

Yeah, uh, niggas go out sad, that is pitiful (Woah)
Yeah, got some shooters, I swear they'll get rid of you (Bow, bow)
Yeah, grown men always tryna pick at you
I got a Glock, if you get shot, I'll show you what this stick'll do
If you was the one that was in my shoes, you prolly would risk it too (Woah)
I must got God on my side, 'cause these niggas be missin' you
You isn't me, poppin' somethin', two up in me
Got my boys in the stu' up with me and we still poppin' shit like an inner tube [Bridge: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
You told me you froze up
All I did was kiss you on your shoulder
I do it every time I bone her
And she get upset when I don't post her
But you the one that make me fold up
Under pressure like I stole some'
And I can't lie, I want you closer
And I would never go expose her
[Outro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
But if you hold me down, then I'm gonna hold you down
But if my money is gone, would you still be around?
I don't know what you doin' when I'm not around?
And you don't know what I'm doin' when I'm out of town"

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy

Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy

I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this

Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real [Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed, with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leavin'
Why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'ma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo!
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind-blowin'
Ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't ever been on my level
I got a problem with the way they keep on talkin'
And actin' like everybody gonna get it

Father forgive me, for I am a sinner

Better feed me rappers or feed me beats, agh!

I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complainin', I'm just bein' honest
I promise that I will not beg for respect, nah!
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I've created
Time is wasting, and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job, me, I don't have no patience
I keep pacing,
 back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 'Cause you actin' like you read my pages
I wreck these stages
Real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, agh!
I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan (Woo!)

They might hate it
But you know anything about me
You know that don't mean I'm changin'
'Cause you know I'm real with it
Don't care if you feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
You don't like it? Then deal with it
And if God ain't real, real isn't
Used to wonder why I existed
I exist in the world that's real different
And, ""What you gon' be when you grow up, Nate?""
I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off-limits
I'm off in a world you don't get
'Cause you ain't ever been in it
In ten minutes I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protectin' 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life
Then don't get so sensitive when I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is?
I stand out 'cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest
And every time I look into the mirror I don't forget about where I started, woo! [Outro]

And turn around, let me see you
Wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm
[Chorus]
Your body’s poetry, speaks to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)
Your body's poetry, speaks to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?

I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Poetry in your body
Got it started, it'll never end
Feel my rhythm in your system
This is living, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest
Beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from its cage
Free the rage like an animal [Chorus]
Your body's poetry, speaks to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight

You would think that I could find
A simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PhD
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me, you'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways
[Chorus]
I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
[Verse 2]
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways (As the wisest of men)
Oh perhaps some day but for now I'm grateful
To be a part of the family tree
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again [Chorus]
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
[Verse 3]
Time after time, one more time and again
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old, I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways

Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through

I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain cloud touched my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
I put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 1]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan [Chorus]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain cloud touched my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
I put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you don't wanna to talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.: We should be together too [Chorus]
My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain cloud touched my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
I put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Outro]
And the story isn't over,
 but I have to tell the truth
I know I couldn't do it justice, only one who could is you
Because I idolized you Marshall,
 and nobody understands
Maybe I'm a little crazy, maybe I am just like Stan, damn"

10554,876010,What Time Does The Next Miracle Leave?,Frank Sinatra,"My name is Francis Albert
 (Francis Albert Sinatra)
And I sing love songs mostly after dark, mostly in saloons
I've had some very good years
I haven't missed a whole lot in those firecracker years
And I don't want to miss a thing when the future appears
I like to sit outside on a summer night with a drink in my hand
And a little moonlit music on the stereo
And look at the stars
Then I get an urge to travel through that fabulous sky
If they can do it in the movies, why can't I?
(""Seats are now available on the Satellite Special leaving for Mercury, Venus, Pluto, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune."")
What time does the next miracle leave?
I want to be on board
Save me a seat by the window where I can see
All those marvelous things to be seen out there
(Will the trees be green out there, or bare?)
What time does the next miracle leave?
Let's get this show on the road
And when the satellite tours begin
Count me in, count me in , count me in
Count me in, count me in , count me in (""Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."")
When I arrive at Venus, it will surely be spring
And the girl I have waited for, will be waiting for me
And she'll dance with me all the afternoon
Comfort me when the darkness falls
And she'll still be there in the morning when I need her the most
Maybe when I get to Venus, I will never be lonely again
(""The Satellite Special leaving for Jupiter, Saturn"")
(Jupiter, Saturn)
Jupiter makes with the rain, Saturn makes with the crops
A nicer trade was never made, and hopefully never stops
If Saturn's fields are dry, Jupiter won't stay fat
So Jupiter leaves his faucets on and that is that
(
""Next stop, Pluto -- where the devil dwells, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha""
)
Pluto is a rotten place, an evil misbegotten place
It's Hades (It's Hades)
Filled with graduates of the pen, a sordid flock of criminal men
And ladies (Ladies?) (Ladies, ladies, ladies)
It's pure hell when your journey ends there
But you can bet your ass I'll meet a lot of friends there
(
We did it our way
) (""Next stop, Mercury, Mercury, the messenger, Mercury the messenger"")
Mercury will lead us out to Neptune and his deep blue sea
(And then) And then to Uranus (Uranus)
Uranus is heaven
(Heaven, heaven)
(How will you know, Francis, if it's really heaven?)
How will I know?
I will know
If they meet me at the station with a cheese and tomato pizza
Well done (well done),
 
and a little red wine
(""The Satellite Special now leaving non-stop for earth, non-stop for earth"")
(We'll be on board when the next miracle leaves
It's time we were gettin' on home)
Please let me off at the desert, where I can see
All those wonderful things to be seen down there
(
Will the trees be green down there, or bare?

How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

You say you love me
And I hardly know your name

There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving

Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through [Chorus]

(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's

Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right? [Chorus]

But there's no way it has to be

Yeah, uh, man
Thanks for the love and support baby, thank you
I hate you
[Verse 1: DMX]
Hate who I love, blessed with the curse
I was born to die, best of the worst
Wings but can't fly, but first things first
I will until I'm stretched in a hearse
Niggas don't get me, but I ain't complicated
Thing about the truth is most niggas hate it
Didn't ask God for what I wanted, I waited
Until He felt like I earned it, then he gave it
Anything worth havin' is worth earnin'
The true nature of man is definitely worth learnin'
'Cause why you're concerning yourself with discernment
Whether its worth savin', its usually worth burnin'
I knew from the start that this life wasn't mine
That's why from the start, I put my life on the line
Gangstas runnin' 'round cryin' about dyin'
I got faith, I'ma go when its my time!
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
How many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem

Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? [Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]

To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels 
fall off

Yeah yeah
)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many 
real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory
[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?
[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts [Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free
[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"

Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?

The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker [Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police [Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
[Outro: 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that"

I wish I had a PA system for all the brothers we love
For the ones that was missing but joined the cut where we from
See how the DA did 'em, when they was hustling drugs
And that was in the city of brotherly love
See brothers are amused by other brother's reps
But it takes a real one to keep the other in check (Other in check)
So this fraternity's for eternity (
Brothers forever
)
And every rhyme I write is 25 to life (
Brothers forever
)
Every dime I wife thought I was Brian McKnight
And my homies said that you should shine your light
And the groupies gave us the time of our life
And I think about those times when I'm flying a flight
And I knew we'd reconnect when the timing was right
Man, I ain't spoke to you in like forever (
Brothers forever

Maybe it's time we put the band back together

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him [Pre-Chorus]

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long [Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything

Baby girl what's this about
Invite me in and kick me out
Theres better ways to deal with this
Does it offend you that I'm real as shit
Ain't another dude as tough you feel me
I mean who love you like I love you really
Whats up with this distancing
I dont feel significant
Hold up wait girl hold just a min
I need this moment just to vent
Incidents I can't control
Came up out I had to go
You knew I was coming back
You wanted that I had to grow
Said you could get past my past
So what we moving backwards for
Who knew it would take this long
You never mentioned that before
How could you diss me this me
Kiss me dismiss me just leave
Bitch we history mystery
Haunts me how you smile don't miss me
Want me need me call me
Deeply heal me hear me touch me see me feel me
See she guilty look away
Crooked love can't look my way
Took a day to write you this
For night you miss in light of this
Cuz I made it despite of this
Lets make a night of this
Fire lit glass of wine relax your mind we passin time
Ashes from the passions of our past just fly
And its fine
Damn it's time to accept it I never hear your voice again
Its so hard to say goodbye but thats what turns boys to men
The choices in
Life never seem fair
But they bring light to the things never seen there
So at least for the time that it took
When you climb and you look
You done made it to the clean air
Breathe in enjoy it cuz some seek joy just to destroy it
Distorted visions don't playback the way they were recorded
Why can't sometimes life be edited minus all the bullshit
Get a full grip fast forward through the open road
When life push your buttons you dont seem to have remote control
I hope that your soul is safe
I hope all your goals in place
I hope that it goes away and everything just goes your way
I hope when foes oppose you they get stuck with the frozen face
I hope I can motivate somebody to grow today
I hope that you go hard and even though things dont go your way
Hold up wait Even though you broke my heart
I'm still wishing you the best
I'm just gonna play my part
If someone's willing to invest
This has been my blood
This has been my tears
This is been a pain I felt inside my heart for years
I been workin so hard I know they gotta feel the bars
This ain't bout no girl this bout the deal I lost
Yeaaa,ey yo check this out
I like to dedicate this song to…
All my failures in life
Everything that I ever endured that just made me stronger…
It made me realize that
It's not the end, it's not where it stops
Anybody could do it…LETS GO!!!

Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will [Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her ""go on! Pop that pussy for me""
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses
They say ""choose wisely"" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!
[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will [Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin', I tell 'em ""perate""
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it
[Chorus: Drake]
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction [Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless

And I will get you, get you alone

That nothing safe is worth the drive

I'll follow you, follow you home

725,590,Forgot About Dre,Eminem,"[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Hoe, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me [Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (
Dada?
) [Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease,
 but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of 
C-Compton!
 (
Compton!
)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad 
tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch [Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips

Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, ""I feel you, nigga, I already know""

Gave you little help, you need more already

Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know

FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy

You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey
[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me [Verse 2]
I sing, ""I write my own tune and I write my own verse,"" hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah
[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man [Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady
[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough [Chorus]
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
[Instrumental break]
[Bridge]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning
[Verse 4]
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
[Bridge]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
[Instrumental break]
[Interlude]
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea
[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
[Verse 6]
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this
[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man
[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu

Gotta let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

Is there a bone in my body that's not weak for you?
Well if you find one let me know
And I can still feel the way you'd hold me next to you
And I don't wanna feel it anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you didn't ever touch me that way just know I know I wouldn't be the same
If you never put your love in my brain, just know I know
[Chorus]
That I'm weighed down by your beautiful
Collapsing underneath your perfect
Drowning in your wonderful
And I'm letting you sink in
It's, it's almost unbearable
I'm suffering inside your magic
Love you something terrible
And I'm letting you sink in
And I'm letting you sink in
[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go I'm reminded of you, like
The bed, the bathroom floor, the bar downstairs at 2am, and
I'm trying to forget the things you used to do, like
Kiss me harder in the bar downstairs at 2am [Pre-Chorus]
But if you didn't ever touch me that way just know I know I wouldn't be the same
If you never put your love in my brain, just know I know
[Chorus]
That I'm weighed down by your beautiful
Collapsing underneath your perfect
Drowning in your wonderful
And I'm letting you sink in

968,3350697,Offended,Eminem,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
, ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'!""
Only time you get the blade is
Probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing
I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby
A lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blond fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And Senator Mitch McConnell’s
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—
Shit's on, bruh! (Ha-ha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya [Chorus: Eminem & 
Kent Jones
]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms 
(
I hope you offended
)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (
I hope you offended
)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (
I hope you offended
)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds
[Verse 2: Eminem & 
Paul Rosenberg
]
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam
On nanny cam, I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys
In the Caddy armrest, 
I'm imaginin' objects
So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck
Got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)
Grow up?
Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins
Like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (
Em…
)
So's my manager
Bitch, I amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me—
'Cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific
So smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on 
Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway
I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been makin' wedding plans all day [Chorus: Eminem & 
Kent Jones

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms

Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a 10, you’re an eight (Urinate)
Like what I do before, after, and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest
And find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder (R. Kelly with a full bladder)
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me
In some holy water, with some floaties on
And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me
While you hose me off and, nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained
Dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (Uh-huh)
I get why you're tapped
""But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back!""
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie
When life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad:
Don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders
Belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (Sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (At his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (Attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage (Minimum wage)
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this, I can simply because I can [Chorus: Eminem & 
Kent Jones
]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms

And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt

You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up

I hope you offended

I hope I don't miss

Write a song to share the meaning
Of the love for you I'm feeling
People saying what they will
I don't care

Love, love, haha, yeah
[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
We could be free
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe, I could learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, truly
And love could wash away all the sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed, if it means
We'll make a better today, not tomorrow
[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
One day I dream of telling my momma
""You ain't gotta work no more""
Same for my father, born in Ghana
Down on that dirt road floor
As far as he came I can't complain
But pain is so subjective
Spend so much time countin' issues
I forget to count my blessings
Watch my cousins back at home
Getting water out a well
While I watched my brother stacking stone
Whippin' water by the scale
Tryna' get a mill' on the other side
They ain't got a meal, we don't recognize we in heaven
So we think we live in hell
It's been getting kinda hard to tell, but [Pre-Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I'm alive when the realest niggas die
But my pride won't let me give up Lord, as hard as I try
In those times I try to remember
[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
That we could be free
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe, if I could learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, truly
And love could wash away all the sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed, if it means
We'll make a better today, not tomorrow

Love (Yeah) love (Yeah)
Love, we'll make a better today, not tomorrow
[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I don't want to wait for the afterlife
I don't want a vigil by candlelight
I don't want to be the new sacrifice
I don't want to turn into a poltergeist
Be a ghost at night full of broken dreams
Momma cryin' at an open casket
Cold as ice in a suit, three-piece
All dressed up for Sunday masses
Pastors said put faith in God
But faith alone can't make things right
Fuck is you to patronize somebody's son who daddy died?
Why they flood Baton Rouge?
Why the city singing Alton's blues?
Why, why, why, why?
I feel like Jadakiss every time I watch the news
What the fuck I got to lose?
So I'm down to bleed if it means things improve
You fools, saying ""all lives matter""
But it's black lives you refuse include
Blocked from the polls, locked in the hood
Trying to stop you from voting and stop you from growing
And cops keep blowing and blowing
Keep black people rocking the cotton they don't want you to own but [Pre-Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I survived all the days that I could have died
Who am I in my place to contemplate suicide?
In those times I try to remember
[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
That we could be free, truly
If we'd only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe, I could learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, you and me
And love could wash away all the sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed
If it makes a better day than tomorrow
'Cause only…

I did every single goal that I wrote down
Checked it off, it's old now
And that shit give me chills, fuck I gotta take yours?
I'm the originator, make it, then I make more
Written in stone, you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same buildin' on the same floor
Old boy black out
Dough boy cash out, payroll, contract maxed out
Cash kid, cash cow
Tapped in, I can't tap out
Bitch, keep thinkin' I'm sleepin' in
Tony on the monitor, I see your ass creepin' in
Lil' bitch, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't exist, you get the gist?
Fuck a cease and desist, they shootin' up seats and exits
Throwin' plays to my bros, I'm leadin' the league in assists
Hopscotch, blacktop, I ain't been skippin' a step since
Real estate, Zillow every day, bitch, I might just change my profession
Dodged so many rainy days, it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested
[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go then)
[Verse 10: Sada Baby]
Hmm, fuck the bullshit
I ain't here to make no friends, can't get bool with me
Since an adolescent, I was ignorant, up in school trippin'
Pistol at my desk, I was sittin' up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket, play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick, both balls licked, and do it to me
Ain't go to college, I ain't want no pussy nigga roomin' with me
Still could've went to college, Sada ain't no fool, nigga
Every clip we got extended, yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on your niggas, scrape them boys for half a biscuit
Know I like the burner, but I'll beat your ass, this shit personal, huh
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh
[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go, Royce)
[Verse 11: Royce da 5'9""]
Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artists, don dada, to G
Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather, and P
D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada, and Tee
Standin' on the corner three days
Phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or gold Ellesses
These are ordered from the older East Bays
She either rollin' with the owners or the lessees
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'
I thought I told you motherfuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide, got arenas buzzin'
We survived gettin' fronted by Ilena cousin
Before you could sell that Cole and Adele
Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight has been fixed since the openin' bell
And you know who postin' your bail? Who promotin' your L?
Who be hopin' you fail? Nigga, Oprah and Gayle
Ignore the hate, show the world that we love the opps
Call Lyor great while they make rape Russell docs
Nah

[Verse 12: Eminem]
Bitch, you have never said a clever line ever
You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth
Rest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off (What?)
The plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah
Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran, bitch
And I'm strapped up with ammunition
And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing
But I only need one to clap
Animal ambition
The only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash
Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'
Bitch, if you pull up with the stick
It's a car with a manual transmission
The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one
Voodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns
When I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it
This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital
And I get off like an acquittal,
 
I spit it, you critique it
It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets
It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka
And walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it
You want smoke? I'm like hookah
Man, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas
Run home and go fuck my room up
These streets will try to vacuum you up
That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba
But even if I would've went the indie route
I don't have any doubt
I would still get blown like it's windy out
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi
Who am I offending now?
Got so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed
Had to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds
You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper
Middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors
I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting
Dick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing
I don't think it'd be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'
But I should say bye-bye, earthlings
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this ""Grindin'"" beat, yeah
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw
Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise (Pull it, surprise), like Kendrick Lamar
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog
'Cause y'all are missing a heart
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
Y'all got detention tomorrow
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal
Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl
I'm invincible, I've been through it all
Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall
My back was against
Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law
Oh
Oh, fuck it"

The Benz coupe look like a fish tank with a shark in it
Penthouse got a livin' room with a garage in it, I can park in it
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Wheezy outta here
[Verse 1]
I'm God to you niggas, I worked too hard just to spoil you niggas
You need to pay me my respect
Your socks, rings, and your lean
The way you drop your mixtapes, your ad-libs and everything
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
They jumped on my wave before they throwed Max in the cage
I was gettin' 30K a show
I was the ghost behind the page, 
I freestyle every day
I never depend on none of these rappers, 
they bite me anyway
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Who a bigger influence than me in fashion? And I ain't kissin' asses
Far from social media happy, I'm lookin' past it
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
If you look into my eyes, tell me what I'm thinkin'
I'm smellin' like kush, 
promethazine
 drinkin'
This ecstasy the only reason why my heart beatin'
I need you by my side, it's very therapeutic
And I'm goin' to the moon, I'm the man, man [Chorus]
I'm fresher than them every day
We makin' love every time she come through
Tell me
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
Tell me, ""You a god""

The G-Wagen not for the 'Gram
Ain't gon' sponsor no basic bitch who tryna expose who I am
I don't need betrayal
Let me have my way, but now you know you can't share
I know life ain't fair sometimes and real niggas rare
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
I don't do side bitches, they all my bitches
I ain't tryna hide bitches, I don't need the media in my business
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true
I've been abused by struggle
I don't know what's real
I'll die for you
Die for you

I'm fresher than them every day
We makin' love every time she come through
Tell me
Damn, that's crazy, but it's true

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door, and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine
[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable [Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you

It's a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake, and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Though, you know love is blind

again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there, because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke 
bars
 full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves

It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates (straight up)

Just like it's fuckin' taxes
You made it up while we made it happen
I kill shit to just kill time, no chill time
In the field on time every time like it's drill time
I took a break from my girl so she still fine
Took a break from the game, but it's still mine

Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need

But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix [Chorus: Betty Wright &

[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, see, I know I can make a lot of money doing this, man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with, you know what I mean?
I know you just, pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling, and just, uh, get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Shame on him! (what?)
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar,
 grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers [Outro: Ab Soul]
Aw I don't believe that man
You're too professional with it man
There's no way you've never done it before, you know what I mean?
That was too descriptive"

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
[Pre-Chorus]
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive [Pre-Chorus]
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?

I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and
Everybody seems to lost their mind
It's hard to handle, so I change the channel on the
Radio... 'Cause internet killed the radio star
Radio... And YouTube killed the video star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
[Verse 1]
Picture me rollin' Pac,
 it's funny how time has changed
Everybody's a critic now, it's all a debate on the internet wave
It used to be you and Biggie, Chili Pepper's Give It Away
Now we got ten year-olds sittin' back in a chair like ""those were the days""
And though it seems so amazin' to me that the labels lost the touch
And I'm in the AM, flippin' through the A.M. like I lost my crutch
Limpin' 'cause I can't even walk straight if I can't turn it up
Sippin', 
I need some Gin and Juice, Snoop Dogg, I brought my cup
What's up, ah ha, okay, shut up
'Cause I think we had about enough of radios and lust with the love bugs
Well let me give you a big hug a bag of mushrooms, here, take some drugs
And play some group home or something
Shit, the Goodie Mobs Soul Food is bumpin', rewind

Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and

Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star
Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star [Verse 2]
You'll never hear Black Star 'cause the program director is mostly deaf
And you'll never hear triple six 'cause we live in the midst of the Bible Belt
But that's when the light is filled, so let it shine
Let em' rhyme, let em' hustle, let em grind
Let em' roam with the truth sometimes
Sometimes, the truth is dark but the darkness sparks the truest art
And you didn't even know you had a window till a tornado blew it apart
If Eric Clapton could sing about cocaine,
 then there's no harm
Then I can write about guns, I can rap about girls
I can sing about money and cars
Not that my money is large
Let's talk about broke is a joke
Let's talk about gettin' evicted
Everything you owned thrown out on the road
And maybe that there goes gold
Shit maybe it’s platinum sold
But they don't want to see the green leaves from the pirates' gold
Oh no, hold up, rewind
[Hook]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and

Hit the radio, we can make a- make a video, now I'm a star [Verse 3]
Pick up the change, pick up the change
Ride in a Chevy 'cause I'm sick of the Range
Catfish Billy come pick up the name
Come on inside, if you're sick of the rain
Turn the radio off and don't complain
It's all a replay, it's all the same
Got one drag, on a runaway train
On a one way street, better pick your lane
Yeah, but you could let me pick your brain
And we could be that Rolling Stone
Mix 'em up with Janis Joplin
And let 'em harmonize like Bone
Or we could just leave it alone
And let it take on a life of its own
Or we could be that World Class Wreckin' Cru
And tell 'em to turn the lights back on
C'mon

I can't seem to get you off my mind
Turn on the station, but I'm still facing you and

Been sleeping with demons and how they get there? She invited them over
And he came in girl form, so pretty, I fell for it, it felt like I known her
I pray to the angels but the devil is stronger
Wonderin' why I'm in hell, still?
Nobody's nice, nobody cares here
I tried to break free, she wouldn't let me
She said, don't waste my time, thinking I'm going to heaven

Way out of they range, got to feel my rage, drug traffickin' made me
Ambition saved me, hold up on the pavement
Ain't going out sad like Jose Canseco, I up my status
Had to 'crease me hunger, get me pesos, I was right with the Yayo
Droppin' off a hundred elbows with a fine bitch in stilettos
Got stars in it, it's a shuttle
Gettin' nauseous, all the decimals
She give me sloppy on another level
Doing crossfit, I'm getting healthy
Bitch moshpittin' at the W
You live marvelous, you get a W
Keep a short stick and a duffle
Tryna flex, I show muscles
Hi-definition, totin' cutters
I was presidential, more bullets
Feel played 'bout it, get to trippin'
I'm with the Cartel every time I re-up
On the plane by the runway, that's how they greet us
Getting it grande from Sunday to Sunday
I knew I'd be the plug one day
This money like a drug
Dope so pure can't touch it without the gloves
Money machine clickin' give me a rush [Chorus: Kodak Black]

Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you [Verse 3]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you, we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Asunder, free to roam, baby

'Til my heart, you chose
Now I got a home, baby

Ever since that moment I know that I know that you're the one
Gotta keep it deep in your mind, I promise the only one
Baby girl I need you, I breathe you, no I could never leave you
I just don't have it in my heart to deceive you
Wherever I go she go, wherever she goes, that's my home
I've been thinking about it
I'm making it rain for myself but i'm digging about it
Man, feeling so crowded, need to be alone
No, I need to be away from my phone
No, I am not in a positive zone
And that's the reason why you are my home
Need to be gone
Need to be getting it on
Need to be getting it on
Need to be driving
Need to be lovin' and vibin'
You're the reason I'm surviving
You're the reason I'm alive in this
You're the reason I'm alive in this
You're the reason I'm alive, you're the reason I survive [Chorus: Snoh Aalegra &

You are watching a master at work 
(Yeah)
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
(
You are watching a master–

This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
[Verse 1]
Grew up broke as fuck, rich folks was adjacent
Maryland, starin' out the window for motivation
I remember Lil Bobby, Lil B
Man I wish that I could be a dog in a rich family
Oh how nice would that shit be, my life a catastrophe
Now my shit a masterpiece, No Limit like Master P
Now I am the master, see, that's the way it has to be
My life is a movie, I'm so glad God casted me
I am not top ten, more like top three
I am not two 'cause nobody could top me
Get the pussy wet like Jodeci, you know it's me
I can't seem to put my finger on it like a rotary
But somethin's missin' from the game, when I'm gone, oh it's me
I feel sorry for these rappers comin' up, woe is me
I just took a hiatus and wrote a novel, motherfucker
I got more verses than the Holy Bible, motherfucker
'Cause I'm sittin' on five, unreleased albums
Greatest of all time, no lyin', that's the outcome
I do it for the boom bap, the trap and the radio
Fuck a fake fan, steppin' to me, try to play me, ho
I make music for every genre, every occasion
My shit is amazin', I'm blazin', it's insane
Going crazy in the gym, goin' in gains
Had a lot of dark nights, but bitch I been Bane
I was born in the darkness like Rick James, bitch
Sippin' scotch with Chappelle after the Grammys
Said them countries wasn't shit holes, they prolly wanna ban me
'Cause I say the shit that others won't, prolly can't stand me, uh
Like these rappers claim to hate me, but they stan me
I said these rappers claim to hate me, but they motherfuckin' stan me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me
There's nothin' but legendary shit that be goin' on, the phenomenon [Chorus]
You are watching a master– at work
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
[Verse 2]
I got my rap and I got my gat
Yeah they got my back, but I won't bust back
Unless I need, this world is greed, I lead by example with ample
Education, my lyricism is here to imprison your vision
The fallacy society has rejected, I'm here to protect it
Everybody di–dies deep within this world we live in, and not everybody tries, but everybody lies
You can't take– money with you when you die so spend it and don't look back like an addict in recovery
But also don't blow it, you know it, don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic
Live your li-life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it
Don't murder others 'cause you disagree with they beliefs
We all the same underneath
I had some shit I had to get off of my chest in that first verse
But this verse come first when it comes to importance of message
(Do what you love, do what you love)
Do what you love, do what you- do it, do it
(Do what you love, do what you love)
Don't do it, don't do it, that's society
(Don't do it, don't do it, do it, do it, do it)
Break free from the cycle, don't be scared to walk like Michael on the moon
RattPack be the platoon, so much more is comin' soon
Yeah I've been goin', I'm already knowin', know Bobby been flowin'
My shit get around like a woman that's hoin'
My body been growin', my mind been growin'
I'm already knowin' that I'm gon' die one day, you gon' die one day, we all 'gon die one day
God already got the date set, so live your life, live yo' life
Yeah you live it, that's a bet, 'cause if you ain't fulfilled in the end
You gon' be filled with regret, bet [Chorus]
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
You are watching a master at work
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement

[Verse]
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed,
 I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train [Outro]

It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny

I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid [Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear
 
my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause [Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say
[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah [Outro]
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like

Catch a nigga slippin', put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk,
 
call it what I'm livin' like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I, I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance,

My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, 
still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothin' but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop runnin'
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunnin'
Down the innocent, in the beginnin' it's:
""You was doin' 50 in the 35"", the endin' is:
""You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'""
Damn, a blessin' in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last ki
Could it be that maybe God has intervened?
Spared my life like he did so many times in between?
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowin' Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now as back then, nothin' stepped on

Cracks in the wall
, standin' in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war,
 barely wanna talk
Ballys on my nigga as they walkin' back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's somethin' for his mother
It never is enough, tryna show her that I love him
We were fishin' buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas gettin' robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bendin' corners
Always keep in mind you'll fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the agents
When you parkin' all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals drippin' on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw

Uh
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me [Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing
[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready [Chorus]
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips

And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go [Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole

Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless [Verse 2]
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
[Chorus]
In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless [Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""
[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""
[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Mil años no me alcanzarán para borrarte y olvidar

Let me just set the scene
I'd just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween
Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave
'Cause the potential of us, it was keeping me up all night long
I left a text you won't read all night long
[Chorus]
This could be a disaster
There's so many factors, like, what if you freak out
And then we're losin' it all at the critical chapter
Where I say, ""I love you"" and you don't say it after?
This could be a disaster
I'm pedaling backwards by sayin' that ""I'm drunk
I really shouldn't have called,"" I'm a little bit plastered
You call me a liar, now I'm fallin' in faster
This could be a disaster
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, disaster
Oh-oh-oh, disaster

Let me just lose my mind
Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night?
You know, Ashley believes that there's something between you and I
But if I'm readin' it wrong, then it'd be better off if I died, oh
And if you're readin' the text all night long [Chorus]
This could be a disaster
There's so many factors, like, what if you freak out
And then we're losin' it all at the critical chapter
Where I say, ""I love you"" and you don't say it after?

Goddamn, the more they hate us, that just motivate us
I know revenge tastes the sweetest, mmm, I'm gon' savor
I'm just sending all my graces up to my creator
No negotiation, this is world domination
You can fill the trophy cases up with nominations
I'm the Alpha-Omega, that mean you can't replace us
That mean I'm throwing dice in Vegas, betting all the wages
My girl expensive, remember you get what you pay for
Big, big pay-off moves on and off the radar
You can't afford to miss a layup when you in the playoffs (Uh)
Press on, stress on
I give this shit blood, flesh, bone
Can't catch me, I skate to my destiny
That's necessity, you can't out-finesse me

Touch me, tease me, please me, just don't test me

The heaviest intoxication make the problems weightless
I'ma need some sanitation for the time that's wasted
Told my shrink that life is crazy, he said, ""Life is crazy""
I bought a house so fucking big it feel like I'm my neighbors
I told my weed man, ""I need nature,"" he accommodate me
I got two choppers look alike, I call 'em crock and gator
The flowers looking quite amazing, I ain't like the fragrance
I stand beside a baby, see who you decide to play with
I'ma take my fucking chances, I'm a lucky bastard
My heart race 'til it catch up to who it's running after
Oh my gosh, I'm gone, I'm on a planet I'm not knowin'
Said, ""Let there be light,"" but then all my lights were blown
Yeah, I know my rights, I mean I know right from wrong
I know yayo white and sweeter than a yellow bone
I know love is life and I know life is never long
I made plans to get away and in the morning, I'll be gone

Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence?
Oh, well, she's a local girl
No make-up 'cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
Is it fast food? I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

I don't wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone [Chorus]

Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else

And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night 'til the floor feel us
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too?
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright, I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing
She said, ""I wanna take off what you're wearing""

And I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone [Chorus]

Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holla, ""What's up?"" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me?
Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?

And so she said ""Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, ""Hi, Daddy""?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?""
Sometimes [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
[Bridge: JaVonté]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there
[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love"

And you see me from the street, but I don't 
turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel somethin'
Would you still come lookin' for me?

I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated

My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with [Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a 
Glock with a dick

They gon' be hollerin' out, ""

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me [Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

There's only one number one
There other niggas my sons
And you can never be, be like me
And you can never do it, do it like me
Ain't none of these niggas seeing me
Ain't none of these niggas repeating me
Ain't none of these niggas defeating me

Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you have a nigga feeling good
Wanna show you how much, how much you're understood
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, but you're patient with me, babe
Wanna to show you how much I care about your heart
Show you how much I don't like (like) being apart
Wanna show you, show you, show you 'til you're hearin' me
Keep it how it is, so we can never say how it used to be

Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin'

Thirty-seven on my wrist, a hundred-five on my neck (Yeah)
This rap money's okay, but 
you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash

My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm, but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (Doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes (Toes)
 and got 
duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose (The nose), the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But Black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (Uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is"

Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together,
 
headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but— [Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry,
 rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it, though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom [Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied [Chorus: Rihanna]

Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, 
but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs
 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, 
let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it [Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts

That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

Your name, forever the name on my lips

The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions [Pre-Chorus]

Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss [Chorus]

Swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close, 
gross when we give them a dose
Got them OD-ing, leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze, take notes, rock Rolls, diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up

Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa

And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?

I thought that you needed love
No, I don't wanna think about you right now

Now I'm not really one for drinkin' songs but
Fuck it, here it comes, uh
Heartbreak is annoying
And I'll feel it in the morning
Swallow it down like a bitter pill
At least it'll taste better than this feeling will

I woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be goin' through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
That's why I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas wanted you dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it, the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected 'cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, with his family support
He knew who shot him but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga

With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where?
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care?
That's why bitches get fucked then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them ""less talk, more sex""
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happen if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it and buy my lolo some spokes
Right up in your face, said ""I'll fuck you up like some mace""
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face

Holy shit, oh, lord, where is the world today?!

Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out

Bitch, I've been blazin', I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch
Let the haters kick rocks
, my shit is tip-top
I never flip-flop, why? 'Cause my soul too strong
Did this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long
The flow sophisticated
All these youngins do is whine like they inebriated
I'm hated, but yeah, that's how you know I made it
I'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this

They say they want the old Logic, the one that flow like a faucet I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they agnostic
If I spit over the boom-bap, then they perceive it as nostalgic
But the truth is, my subject matter has been the same
And my production selection is still flame
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame And you still they little secret

You could put me in check
But I'm still laughing all the way to the bank
I'm the reason that the Titanic sank
I'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire

I usually come around on the first and fifteenth
If you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath
People go crazy when they feel me
In the Middle East they drill me
If you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me
I knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade
Always schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid
Now they never graduated, thought that shit a charade
Only thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid
Then one day, they had a falling out on the block
See, one thought the other one had been stealing his rock
'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock
Pulled out the Glock and his homie yelled, ""Stop!""
But before he had the chance to pull the trigger
Oh shit here come the cops

Won't take your love for granted, it could all be gone today
Let's get away, tucked off, way out in Monterey
You said you scared of heights, but I know you ain't scared to ride
Come where I reside, pull them panties to the side
Fuckin' when you mad, make me love when we collide
Could tell I was invited how you let me come inside
Made me switch plans, had to change up the course
And we know that love don't feel the same when it's forced
You could pick, we hoppin' out the Range or the Porsche?

Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows

So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight

The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand

Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some?

Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snapback
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
High to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' 'til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini, speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me [Refrain: Mac Miller]

Shorty used to all these players, tell her, ""Fuck with a coach""

Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do

Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me

Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day [Pre-Chorus]

I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now

We be all night, love, baby, love [Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on,
 
bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty,
 niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it,
 
droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, 
I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

And I woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby, drunk in love

Yeah
[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now? [Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah
[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your—'member, love yourself [Outro]
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah"

I put a circuit in Kate like a waitress
She gave me somethin', that's one hell of a facial
I wasn't nervous, I hold it an' sprayed it

Ridin' in a foreign and you got your new girl (Woah)
While you pourin' on syrup, yeah [Chorus]
I'm gettin' some throat in a foreign
Take me way, way out
I was just goin' on a run
Goin' way, way out
I paid these dues with my sons
Moved 'em way, way out
Took the detour, made 'em reroute
Ground it up, we don't take a day off
I stack it up, I don't take a day off
Hit the winnin' shot, got us in the playoffs
I never switched, I knew it'd pay off
I'm absolutely goin' brazy"

I mean man are you serious man? You opened up for Pitbull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman, and Ludacris?
Man get the fuck out of here, man I know you lying
Dog, I'm telling you the truth man, look, I came on stage and he was like ""He goes by the name of Psychological. Alright, lyrics. give it up for Psychological. Jigga what?
Uh, D.C., Maryland, Virginia make some noise!
Nah, nah, nah, y'all sound dead to me. I said make some noise!""

Back stage, palms sweaty but I'm ready
To kill my set, you know I gotta get the credy
Moments before yeah im feelin' unsure but everybody like ""You dope man we've seen you before""
Gotta stay humble, mind state ready to rumble
Gotta keep my cool in this concrete jungle
Moments before and I'm still feelin' nervous
Roots walkin' up like ""Whats good you ever heard us?"" (Man)
Nah homie, you see I'm kinda in the zone
We can talk later but for now leave me alone
Then the M.C. for the whole event
Comes up to me while I'm chillin' in the tent
Said ""I know you hungry, today you gonna eat, but first theres a couple guys I want you to meet"" (Whats up?)
Took me on the tour bus told me ""Have a seat""
Then a moment later, I met a few from Wu-Tang
It was surreal cause they the reason I'm in the game [Hook]
Make some noise
Make some noise

Off of the bus, gunnin' ready to bust
Rhyme is a must, finna kill it you better trust
My heart's poundin', but calm and collected is how I'm soundin'
Dressed fresh to death go all the honeys drownin'
Grip the mic while the announce my name
Small talk backstage with big names in the game
See I, know the line, between Logic and Bobby
See Bobby, he listen to rap for a hobby
But Logic, sit back relax he ain't got shit
So while the other acts, askin' for autographs
I'm as professional as it gets ain't no need to ask
Why you goin' up to them, talkin' bout you rap
How you this how you that, then like ""hey, can you sign that?""(Please)
I'm on the stage and they like ""I wanna sign that""
[Hook]
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some- [Verse 3]
Off of the stage, the whole crowd feelin' me
Copies of the mixtape what they wanna be
See I ain't never ever seen a concert
But the first one that I went to is the first one that I merked
When I first came on, they wasn't showin' love
When I last stepped off every girl wanted a hug (Haha)
[Outro]
I mean yeah man
It was a real cool experience, you know?
Its the first time I ever really did something that big, you know?
With a few thousand people there and everything
And, I mean it was just tight, you know what I mean?
So, its pretty, its pretty much what I got out of it

You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?

Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, ladies and gentlemen, settle down
Okay, so, this next brother we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights
You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr. Hall
[Verse 1]
Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene
Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given
I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay [Interlude]
Keep that one just in case, yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm just an entity
My DNA, not my identity
Finding serenity
Become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread
Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing
[Verse 3]
Live it, live it
Living life like this is so crazy
Hip-hop is amazing
One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em
Goddamn, what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up, you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9""
Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay, fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing
For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist
Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus
That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me
Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky
Okay, well, maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine, in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up? [Interlude]

Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
Where it's finna stay
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas"

Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But [Hook: Nickelus F]

Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder

Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist [Hook: Nickelus F]

And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician

An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me

Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you
And where do you go?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
You've never seen nothing like it, no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it (and the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
[Chorus]
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)
[Guitar Solo] [Verse 2]
Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little niggah sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
[Chorus]
Black on, black on
Every finger nail and toe, we've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
(A little bit of love and joy)
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
(A little bit of love and joy)
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even 'till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love [Verse 4]
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the black Queen
Ah, ah, ah, ah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5]
Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her i's
(She's our leader)
[Fake Ending]
[Outro]
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la la forever) forever

I asked the Lord to send me a sign
I thought that I was blind
'Cause I ain't ever see the sign but the sign showed after time
And when I finally realized, it was too late to rewind
Guess I was just waiting on that sign
So I got up and went out on my grind
'Cause I used to cry 'cause ain't no food in the house
Seein' all the older niggas, man, they used to shine
Used to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine (Mm-mm)
Hypnotized, I was just nine
Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
Rapping killed time, the years flew by
'Til I got old enough to run up on you with the .9
The light man, we became friends
I see him so much, he cuttin' off the light again? (Mm-mm)
I know his name, co-workers and his kid
He ain't comin' in the work truck, he comin' in his van
The more my stomach growled, the more I wanna lay a nigga down
Take yo' shit and make 'em cry
Mama got robbed in July, I watched her cry
So I don't care about yours 'cause they ain't care about mine
But look at me now, they told me, ""Settle down""
PBL charges got me waiting on trial (Mm-mm)
Oh, so you know now?
The sign read ""Never know until you find out""
The things I found out
But they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if you broke
'Cause if you're broke, they treat you like a bad joke
They don't even wanna laugh wit' you
When you shittin' on 'em, you can make 'em do anything
They'll even wipe your ass for you
In this world full of fame and pretty girls
It can make your mind swirl
But you just gotta think, the devil, he gon' play
Get in your brain, have you runnin' in them banks
But now, I just want the world to scream my name
Don't even club, I'm the reason why they came (Mm-mm)
Takin' people shit, I'm the reason for they pain
Baker Act, I'm all the way insane
Poking houses, goin' crazy 'bout them chains
Them Cuban links and them rings
It's deep, the sign, I couldn't see
Man, look at me now, I'm gettin' weak
Damn, look at me now, I can't sleep
Oh, look at your boy, I can't eat
I'on think, ain't never think
All for some money, I might blow it all in a week (Mm-mm)
But it's Kodak, you niggas know that
I'm 'bout whatever and I'll hit a nigga like a road rat
But fuck that, right now, I'm chilling
Slow money 'cause fast money will get me sentenced
I was in it, they say I'm a menace
Say I'm sleepin', and when I wake up I'll be in prison (mm-mm)
I'm chilling, this how I'm feeling
Give me a deal, give me mill' so I'm finished
Forget it, I'm still willing
To mask up and hit yo' granny for a penny
They say I'm stupid, say I'm foolish
Kamikaze, Baker Act, but I know what I'm doing
Fuck school, everybody on the campus
I did it so I'm ready for all of the consequences
Hard to trust a nigga, do I know you?
They hate lil' Kolyon, so paranoid, might have to blow you
Fuck a friend, family too, I'on know you
Bastard child, hey daddy, I'on know you (Mm-mm) [Outro]
Mm-mm (Mm-mm), mm-mm
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
Just got to maintain, maintain (Mm-mm)
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
Just got to maintain, maintain
It's gon' change, gon' change

This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away [Chorus (Extended)]
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away
They gon' know my name until it fade—

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Se que todo fue mi culpa y te cause dolores
Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Por que hoy estoy aquí extrañándote
Okay, tu por mi morias ma'
No solo física, había química
Yo te llamaba y no querias contestar
Se que fui tonto y no te supe valorar
Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende que esto no paso de repente
Si esta en mi manos no lo dejo a la suerte

From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship

Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night?
It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though

Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts

Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous,
 
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(
I've been hungry all my life

I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

Now [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all
[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"

To see

At night's noon-time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke

Ploughman, ""Waggoner Will"", and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly-dally-o
Pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
And

Dirty fellow, what a dirty laddio
Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief
 and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero (Aaaaah!)

Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow

With your vape pen and your finger tattoos
You looked like someone tryna look like you
If that's only in my head
It's water I'm not ready to tread

I wanna make some mistakes, I wanna sleep in the mud
I wanna swim in the flood, I wanna fuck 'till I'm done
I like whiskey on ice, I like sun in my eyes
I wanna burn it all down, so let's start a fire
I wanna be lost, so lost that I'm found
Naked and laughing with my blood on the ground (My blood on the ground)
[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear
[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you [Verse 2]
May the light be upon me
May I feel in my bones that I am enough
I can make anywhere home
My fingers are clenched, my stomach's in knots
My heart, it is racing, but afraid, I am not (Afraid I am not)
[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
'Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear
[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
(Oh, ah)
Oh (Oh, ah) [Bridge]
I can think of one thousand places
Much worse than this
[Chorus]
But I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
Know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
'Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you

Where does everybody go when they go?
So let me ask you
Oh, let me ask you (Oh, ah)
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh, ah)

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?""
""It's me and Kelly!""
""My bad"" (Sorry)
""Let's try another room""
""I don't trust you""
""Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods""
""Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab""
""Oh dag"" (Mmm)
""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag""
""Huh?"" [Chorus]

I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)""
She said, ""Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure""
I said, ""I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me""
She said, ""I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook""
""(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate"" [Chorus]

""Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful""
""Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled""
""I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you""
""He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude""
""Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?""
""Well, it depends on how many you had""
""I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol""
""She's gonna die, dude""
""I know and it's my fault""
""Oh my God"" [Chorus]

I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)

Doin' hella shows for my fans
And I could tell that everybody want more
Ain't ever wait for nobody, we kicked through that front door
And always did our own thing
Can't tell you niggas wanna front for
We bought cones and stuffed more, past girls, you cuffed yours
Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for?
And all I did was make time but I ain't take enough for myself
Just doin' shit for everybody else, I ain't hardly even by myself
Family time is slowed down, cause they want me to burn out
Seen the end of this movie, they don't know how it turns out
Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song
If I don't take time to embrace it
What's the point of doin' this for?
I'm packin' up my bags, book a night, another hotel
It's a lot that could go down so I'm hopin' everything goes well
Came in to this game, givin' rules to you lames
Be the one that's holding you down, tryna count you out

And I was gettin' tired of frontin' for the public
Sayin' I could do without it but you seem like you love it
I remember all of the subjects
That we would argue 'bout day and night
Do the best that I can, no matter what, I can't make it right
When you said you felt single, I remember like it was yesterday
How the fuck you hold me down
When you ain't take my last name?
I tried hard to move past things, came home, made shit change
Had to make a hard decision, let you go
It's time to do what's best for me
We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding
I was tryin' to hold it together but I felt like we were ending
I remember the beginning but this ain't nowhere close to that
Seen some shit you didn't like, said some shit that wasn't facts
Never thought 'bout gettin' back by puttin' your business out
In the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down [Chorus]

[Verse 1]
At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, ""Oh my God""
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÚ-lar
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride
Like, ""Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy""
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit [Chorus]

Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood [Chorus]

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
[Verse 2]
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do [Pre-Chorus]
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground

Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Well, you drive me crazy half the time

9586,492328,All I Have,NF,"[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready 'cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up
 and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanna but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind [Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song—ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words and, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down, I'm calm now, listen, I'm just working
Yeah, it might take a minute to get it, but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here, I don't think they see my vision here! [Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
All I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real (this isn't real, this isn't real)
This is all that I have, this is all that I have"

But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Verse]
I been tryna drink less
But I feel like when I drink, I'm at my best
Not a care in the world, no stress
Always give the world my everything and no less
I wake up seven days a week and get the job done
You know I'm always there for my wife and my son
And at the end of the day, I love to pour one
More like two, but occasionally three and it scares me
Not because I have a problem
I'm the type of person, if there's an issue, then I'ma solvе 'em
It's more like seeing how this shit has dеstroyed life
Uh, I look at my mom, I look at my dad
And see how drugs and alcohol took away everything they had
And it makes me sad, I found the balance, but I feel bad
I didn't drink 'til I was twenty-seven, then I did from then
And every time I take a sip, I'm scared that I'll become them
We went to Alcoholics Anonymous mostly twice a week
I was just a little boy, but listened when people would speak
Prostitutes, preachers, substitute teachers
Cops and criminals, they all gave speeches
About this addiction and it filled me with conviction
Keep comin' back, boy, it works if you work it
And it did, growin' up, I was a AA kid
I never wanted to make the mistakes that they did
Yeah, sometimes when I sip, you know, I feel survivor's guilt
But I know that what I'm drinkin' could destroy all that I built
So I tread lightly, this shit leaves people dead nightly
Alcoholic, well, it's in my blood, so I might be
Drug addict, well, it's in my genes, so I might be
But I don't use that shit to escape
I deal with my problems head on 'til this day
Addiction to substance, it was my fate, but I broke the cycle [Chorus]

Lost on a lonely road

So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet

You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems

Her picture in your wallet

Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six

We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies

And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die

Bad bitch, pardon me, I say, ""What's up?""
Educated, so I put her in the cut

Two hoes and I think I did too much
I got two phones and I don't know who to trust
I need a girlfriend

Turnin' out tops and the tall bitches, that remind me of the old days
Sneakin' in hoes with the backstage pass
What they all in, huh, for the poet? Huh
I'm a young poetic nigga, I just go at it, nigga, I'm a ho at it, nigga
You could ask my mama, we poetic, nigga
I was raised in the projects, we could go at it, nigga
I can't waste no time on a co-edded, nigga

Everybody wanna be great, but the work don't relate him to life
Be mistakin' the truth, nigga
I remember bankin' with Chase, like four-hundred K
Starin' at it, I ain't know what to do, nigga
Now I look at money like a resource
Every contract gotta put my kid's family in school
Health and wealth, goin' deep for it, do right for my next life
Let me get some too
I remember roaches, mama lost focus
I was at home, no lights, no food
Heard
 that the joke is ""Hykeem broke""
And head to the ground when I walk in school
Goin' through the motions, mad impulsive
Granny, I won't abide by the rules
I shall reside with advisers to boom
Fuck that, Booman, let me get some too
Life ain't always about your name in they mouth
And the cars and the clothes and the jewels (Jewels, oh)
Every lil' bitch that's born looking like soft porn
Only meant for your ego to bruise (Bruise, oh)
Bet when the hoes get bored and the points ain't score
You gon' live in this world confused ('Fused, woah)
Every day, the hate restored and the faith get short
Fuck that, let me get some too
Nigga, my livelihood was understood
That the roof I'm in not bool
Nigga, the shoes I fill are huge
""Keem, wanna share that ho?"" Bro, move
Nigga wanna fake sneak diss
'Cause I fucked his bitch in a black hatchback
I front in the pics when the heart don't match
Take care of the kids, gotta go where they at, ayy [Part III]

No judgment is our arrangement

But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down

I always get your ass over here somehow

Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead

And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and

I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it
[Spoken Word: Kanye West]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder [Verse: Kanye West]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay"

Ayy, thinkin' about all of the things that I've seen
I'm thinkin' about the American dream
I made it from nothing, but what does that mean?
Without a family, without a team, it’s nothin'
Denials, I can't even bother to wonder
Just what my life would've been like
If I ain't had the homies right there from the jump
Would've been a fiend, would've been a drunk
But they believed in me and it perceived to be all I was doing was right
I was born in the dark, but they showed me the light
Now that's what I call homies for life
Take this advice, don't take the people around you for granted
Do not take advantage it's so hard to manage
A real relationship, yeah

So now I guess this is where we have to stand
Did you regret ever holding my hand?
Never again
Please, don't forget

Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true? Oh why

Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet

Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae,"" I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the mornin'
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in [Chorus: Beyoncé,

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

The poor stays poor, the rich get richer

Get outta here!

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer (Oh-oh)
It's just so disproportionate (Ah-ah)
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it, every rule, I'm breakin' it
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Terrible, but not rip-able, invincible,
 I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe over the world, I stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it, hoes *kiss*
Here we go, bad and evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no
Joke, goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat
Choke *cough*, cough from all the smoke, I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking' water sprinklers, I don't love the hose (Oh)
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
Baggin' that bitch, smother that little motherfucker 'til it suffocates (Who?)
You had long enough of a wait,
 why are they
Tryin' to be so secretive? Bad and evil is reunited, hey!
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straights as I await
Word on Satan is I drop, fall on my knees before this
Ouija board
 
and I pray, now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I’m sleepin' now, imagine if I awake?
I'm champ, bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy
Never mushy, so you can't squish
Nowhere near a tush,
 
in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack's, the only way I'll say I am Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that I brandish
Stand-offish to hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it,
 
so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law? Fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho, 
but now my throat is sore [Chorus: Claret Jai *

No disrespect to Mr. West, shit, I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers want to set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em, left or right? Head or gut!? (Gut!)
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite, 
I could just
Throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it (For the fuck)
Partner, you not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped (Call dropped) [Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate

[Verse 1]
I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' Max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butter Fingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience
[Chorus]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right [Verse 2]
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter, 
crime fighter
Caped crusader
, takin' care of undeservin' limelighters
I think we live an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon his resolution
By usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it
[Chorus]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right [Verse 3]
Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
‘Cause you don't posses the pizzazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire, I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically
Freakin' vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here
[Chorus]
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight
We don't want no one feelin' uptight
’Cause we came here to do this tonight
’Til the morning light
Hope that everyone's feelin' all right"

Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
[Verse 1]
It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason, I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I'd sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life [Chorus]
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say: ""Kanye, he keeps it real, boy""
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
[Verse 2]
It's funny
Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some façade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say: ""where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you to say: ""sign an autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh
[Chorus]
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes [Verse 3]
And there is no Gepetto to guide me
No one right beside me
The only one was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't call her no more
I can't—
The only one that come out on the tour and screams
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get-got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when, uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin' the money that the—
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy
They say: ""Kanye, you keep it too real, boy""
Perspective, and wise man say
One day, you'll find your way
The wise man say you'll find your way
The wise man say you'll find your way

You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem (Yelawolf)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a—
She (Don't give a shit)
[Verse 2: Skylar Grey,

Sometimes I wish that you would just die
'Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good, all you are to me is a [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo—smokin' blow with Antonio
In a back-alley, takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Uh, feel like I've been asleep and alone
And lovin' this angel, entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
Round and round we roll
Where it stops, baby, nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just wanna free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside, 'cause [Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem (Yelawolf)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle

But the worst part of all is she really don't give a—
She (Don't give a shit)

But maybe I'm the twisted one
That screwed this up
So, I guess, this means goodbye...

God is a girl!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherf***in' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look so ridiculous now, look so ridiculous now
Look so ridiculous now, make you look so ridiculous now
Now, now, now, now, now, now...
[Verse 2: Groove Coverage]
Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last [Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
[Verse 3: Eminem]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, there goes gravity
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo! [Interlude: Eminem]
One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My [faggot] father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just [fuckin'] wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest [shit] I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da [killed him, shit], I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 
The Eminem Show
[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it? [Verse 5: Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

53,2953759,Eraser,Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more
[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser [Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more
[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser [Post-Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser
[Outro]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser"

""But I'm only going to get this one chance""
 
(
Six minutes—, six minutes—
)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it""
 
(
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""
[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (
Kill 'em all with
)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce [Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, 
they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of 
shame
You fags think it's all a game,
 
'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and,
 
tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause— [Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard
[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from 
The Mathers LP 1
 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was,
 
but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya,
 
like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (
J.J. Fad
)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,
 
you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
 
so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock,
 
shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues,
 
but it's still tongue-in-cheek,
 
fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for 
Satan
It's a fatal mistake
 i
f you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"

That it had been changing since it was born
That it was I and nothing more

And I have to go
My city's gone

I still found me back in the mall
I will not decline
Still feeling lost and nothing more
I feel lost in time
Does anybody happen to know (Happen to know)
Way after I'm
Still feeling lost and manageable

Tell it all from the heart
I'm sitting out at the bar
Tell it all that I'm making my way"

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
""The Cool""
Turn me up, uh-huh, yeah
[Verse 1]
He came back in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh-to-death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat, like, two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory; he didn't mind it, but—
He couldn't sip it fast enough
So, the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second-grade handwriting simply read, ""I miss ya""
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he... [Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live, then you die
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves (Yeah)
Paying your dues (Uh-huh), chasing the cool
[Verse 2]
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a... hmm... reverse archaeologist
Except his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box;
 
wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he... [Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie (Yeah)
You born, you live, then you die
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry (Ugh)
If you're breaking the rules (Yeah), making your moves (Ugh)
Paying your dues (Ugh), chasing the cool
[Verse 3]
He begged for some change to get him on the train
""Damn, that nigga stank"" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt, but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look; wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter-fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thing—first, he had to find somethin' to sling
Next stop was his block; it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there, so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, ""You're scared, ain't you?""
He said, ""Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangster""
And... [Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie (Ugh)
You born, you live, then you die (Ugh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts

Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon

I remember every one

That's 'cause I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me

Handshake the login, closet is a walk-in
Hit the silent auction, kick that jit for talkin'
Got a girl that work for NASA and she said I'm a star
Got a girlfriend that's a rapper and she set up this bar
Got a model, she don't say shit, she just sat on my car
I try to leave her but I didn't get far, a stupid joke
I know the pimpin' business like that nigga Bubba do the shrimpin' business
We doin' fitness, bitch, my bedroom sound like women's tennis
And it was necessary, that shit hereditary
If I ain't really your daddy, talk to my secretary
Big Chano, smokin' cigarettes inside a grocery store
I got the sauce, I got the clout, I master Roshi flow
I watch 'em closely, can't be turnin' my back
I make 'em line up, take three times like my hat

Told myself not to love these hoes
Told myself not to fall for these bitches
But it's hard to stop fallin' when you trippin' though
I'm pimpin', though, and pimpin' ain't easy, but it's necessary
I could feed eyes to a vegetarian
My main bitch said she feelin' secondary
Love you, worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin', girl
I really wake up in the mornin', look up in the mirror at Wayne
Told 'em, must've haven't met another Tunechi yet
Man, hoppin' off the private plane, lookin' for the doja
I could choose to be a lotta things, I chose to be the chosen
Ain't no simpin', not on this side
Try too hard or quit tryin'
She can't let me go, I'm like a zipline
I told that ho, ""If you gon' be a ho, you better be a good ho
Be the best ho you could be, go get the bread 'fore it's toast""
Boy, I fucked all of your hoes, you be spiralin' your hoes
And if pimpin' is dead, I hope she ain't scared of ghosts

You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it [Post-Hook]
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All in it, all in it
[Vamp]
See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition"

Laughed on the school yard

Would've been right there, front row

Watch my movеs and I'ma show you what a icon like

But listen [Chorus: Cordae]
I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

First and foremost, for every door that's opened, a door close
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road
A dead end, or prison time, where we was headin'
Instead, when I got bread, broke it with brethren
Eyes open, leave the house, move like a veteran
Made a couple dollars from come-ups, my niggas flexin'
Nigga got a problem, then I can make some corrections
Okay, cool, still with the same niggas since grade school
Give a fuck about your Shade Room when I had made room
For everybody on that late moon, and word to Rae Sremm'
Had to bring the motherfuckin' swang on 'em
And I ain't even wanna have to blank on 'em

I done seen some shit within my lifetime, at one time I
Can still remember just how bad I used to want '5 mics'
My biggest dream was just to make it into Unsigned Hype
It's so hard for me to fathom this was once my life
Shit'll make you wanna cop out like a plea deal
So I treat a beat like it's Tekashi, spit on that bitch like Meek Mill
My addiction got me weak-willed
I'm relapsing, I think I can't seem to stop eating Beat Pills
And Doctor D-R-E he still keeps on giving me refills
Send 'em at me, bullets hit indiscriminately
Women and men and little kids senior citizens till the Sig is empty
Whipped Gen-Z into a frenzy, but no give, is in me, I'm stingy
And that is the motherfuckin' difference between them and me
And that's the reason I'm, in my Louis Vuitton
Gorier than Eva Long
This rap shit, is 
somethin' that you'll never see me at, like senior prom
What I mean's the bar's, higher than Cheech and Chong
When you give them each a bong
I call my Stan's a, fan club 'cause whoever it's unleashed upon
Fuckin' beats up on, like police batons
Y'all are window shoppers, bunch a Peeping Toms
Still got that bullseye on my back, red dot on my head
Yeah, blood on my hands for some of the rhymes that I've said
Police squad on the task
Got 'em hot on my trail, like my stepfather with the belt, I got S.W.A.T on my ass
I was painfully shy, now I'm proud of myself
Like Obama's kids, I came outta my shell (Michelle)
And I can promise this
On my mama, shit, no daughters, bitch
That every single word'll be true so with out further adieu
It's return of the ruthless more murderous than Mook is so what you're gonna do's think I'm allergic when I point this motherfuckin burner at 'chu
I throw shade it'll be curtains for you
Pray for the verse to get through, birth of a new
Worser me who's determined to do
Permanent damage with the words that I threw, bird's-eye view I'm referred to as Zeus
Circlin' you like I'm a vulture features are tournaments, I turn 'em into
Turning me loose is like verbal abuse, language hurtful to use cursin' at you
Made a couple of mistakes that occurred in my youth, jumped a hurdle or two word but I'm through
With tellin' you about the food stamps and the government cheese
And how we used to get school lunches for free
Already told ya, 'bout the holes up in my Pony shoes and Rustler jeans
When it was Mother, lil' brother and me
I told you 'bout, being kicked out 20 degrees, no money to eat
'Bout the thrift stores and being piss poor, the Christmases Ma had gifts for us, when bro and me discovered that she
Was wrappin' shit up around the house, to stick it under the tree

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me, you out of your mind

My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one
[Verse 1]
There's ups and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line [Pre-Chorus]
Me and my boo in my boo coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo in my boo coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

Yup, I put it on him, it ain't nothing that I can't do
Yup, I buy my own, if he deserve it, buy his shit too
All up in the store, shorty, trickin' if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Damn, I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy (Boy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I'll never be the same, you and me until the end
[Pre-Chorus]
Me and my boo in my boo coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the flyest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo, and my boo, lip locking
All up in the back because the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London, speed it up, Houston, rock it

Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling

I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
[Bridge: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before
[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you
[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

No, no, no, no

The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute [Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah"

One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes
[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own
[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah [Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy
[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)
Young teachers, student doctors (Yeah)
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sad?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead [Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay [Bridge]
And I thank you (Uh), ‘cause you made me (Uh)
A better person than I was
But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (Uh), you're crazy (Uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone
[Chorus]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""

Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite
[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it [Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Keep on smilin' until it's over
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said

I tried to talk to my piano
I tried to talk to my guitar
Talked to my imagination
Confided into alcohol
I tried and tried and tried some more
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore
Tired of empty conversation
'Cause no one hears me anymore

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening
I talk to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
So, why am I praying anyway?
If nobody's listening

Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?
I need someone, oh
Anyone, please send me anyone
Lord, is there anyone?

I think I cried too many times
I just need some more affection
Anything to get me by

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 
8 Mile
 on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?

Go back to

What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain

My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it

I missed you really, really, really, really bad
And a single tear trickled down my face
While I threw your shit in the fireplace
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day
[Verse 2: Dixie D'Amelio]
I woke up and it was strange (I woke up and it was strange)
All that I felt was relieved
No more feeling second best (No more feeling second best)
I'm cringing at those memories
Like the time that you left me alone at the party
When I didn't even know anybody
Truth is that you really broke my heart
Really broke my heart [Chorus: Dixie D'Amelio]
For one day, one day
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day
I missed you really, really, really, really bad
And a single tear trickled down my face
While I threw your shit in the fireplace
I was really, really, really, really sad
For one day, one whole day

One whole day, ah-ah, ah, ah
One whole day
One whole day, ah-ah, ah, ah (
Okay

One whole day (One whole day)
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Break up, make up, I wake up, bake up
Quit your cryin', why you messin' up your makeup?
Late night, I stay up tryna get my money way up
Soon as I do some wrong, you approach me the day of
You tell me it's over and you're done and you can't take no more
You're walking out the door and I'm here like ""What you waitin' for?""
Just tryna get the truth, I ain't tryna be confrontational
Before you make a decision, I'ma just let you stay for (Uh) [Chorus: Dixie D'Amelio &

Part I: Love Without Tragedy

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low
[Verse]
I ask you, ""What's the matter?""
You say ""Oh, it's nothing at all.""
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice
[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low [Chorus]
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

[Verse 1]
Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen
[Verse 2]
Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment [Verse 1]
Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island

Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me

136,3350680,River,Ed Sheeran,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am [Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck! [Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

River

 river run
Call me

(Ooh), we'll let the river run
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child? [Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 
Eminem
]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (

I fucked up

If all it's gonna cause is pain

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself [Verse 2]

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

There’s an answer if you reach into your soul

 will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
[Verse 1]
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now, you're wearing a badge, you're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but
[Pre-Chorus]
If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money [Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
[Verse 2]
Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers [Pre-Chorus]
If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money
[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)

[Bridge]
You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If it's dealing with God, then you will hell Him
You would do anything for money [Chorus]
Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you (If you want it, you can earn it with dignity)

Lucky me
If they want my spot, then they gotta come for me
Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich in a world where nothing's free
And separated from hell by one degree
Surrounded by niggas who did first degree
And the other ones that never got they first degree, sheesh
Lucky me (
Nigga!
)
Yeah, I done slashed hoes like I'm Slash on some rock star shit
Even bought Slash old crib, that's rock star as it gets
And have my hands on the R&B legends you couldn't handle
Whether you do music or not, you wish you could sample
And I had to live through the scandals
Public humiliations and breakups on camera
It's a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled
And you gotta delete all the photos and shit like you never Instagrammed it
And you get off-track but somehow you gotta stay transit, ha
Man, lucky me
I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19
Could barely stand on my feet
Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat
'Til my mama took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks
Went back to the regular doctors and they said, ""Huh, damn, looks like we don't need to proceed""
That's how I know that western medicine weak
Man, lucky me, to be the chosen one
And saved for the special occasions like I was Opus One
You know, and I'ma live forever like Walt Disney, the frozen one
Done flew so many times past the limit, I didn't even know it was one
And face our problems head-on when they told us to run
And ran it up in a city where no one would come
When I had literally died but then came back alive
And it's the furthest thing that I know from over and done
And I don't even have to say it, you know where I'm from, bitch (
Yeah, yeah
)
Lucky me, lucky who? (
Lucky
) Lucky, true
It's a wonder what prayer, working smart and love can do
And y'all got an efficient and humble crew
And you got a long list of the things y'all wanna do
Shit, who knows, lucky me could turn into lucky you
We turned nothing to something so much it's nothing new
I know lady luck so well, I swear that's like my bottom bitch, number two
Doing what we love and choose with lots to lose and more to prove
Ain't running from nothing but haven't lost sight of the finish line that we been runnin' to
Lil' bitch, this Detroit-fucking-2
My thoughts is all-black, yeah, I'm back to the roots
Fuck your white flag, ho, I don't want no truce
And we all in the huddle, they like, ""It's on you""
Hm, lucky me (Me), pressure's what I eat
Ain't no roses at my feet, just the blood on the concrete, look 
(
Hit-Boy on the beat, so bitch you gotta go berserk
) [Chorus]
The mission is covert
I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word
Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)
My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers
World turned me cold, game turned me colder
Sittin' courtside lookin' like I'm finna be the fuckin' future owner (Woah)
Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)
And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)
[Post-Chorus]
Look, I ain't gon' hold you, though
Put in my family, I feel like Utopia
Falling in love with a slut is my phobia
My whole team first class, so it ain't no coachin' us
[Verse 2]
Woah there, don't go there, now slow down, lil' brodie
I know you don't know me
I'm buffed up, my chest up, I feel like Hulk Hogan
I walk in the building like everybody owe me
Move heaven on Earth, this shit feel like erosion
The Don, I'm the king, I'm consultin' the soldiers
You talk to me nice and not real, I'm insulted
I bet on myself, ain't no way my hand's folding
What's a limitation? Fuck your validation
I don't got a figure, God flow, got it renovated
Demon slayer and my bitch slayin', legendary, it's insinuated
Two guards outside barricaded while I'm serenadin' (Yeah)
Paradise covin' while I'm stroking
Pussy tight, I'm claustrophobic
She so damn down and devoted
Got me wondering what's her motives (What's her—)
Remember my feelings don't mean shit to none of my goals, so I gotta stay focused
The city is soulless, this shit get too vulgar
Seen bodies wrapped up in them white sheets, no COVID [Chorus]
The mission is covert
I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word
Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)
My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers
World turned me cold, game turned me colder
Sittin' courtside lookin' like I'm finna be the fuckin' future owner (Woah)
Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)
And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)

My whole team first class, so it ain't no coachin' us (Yeah), yeah
[Outro]
My whole team first class so it ain't no coachin' us
Nobody over us, 'cept the ones we lost that stay watchin' over us (Amen)

(They say, they say)
They don't know
[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, ""Tell Cara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say ""You ripped, wow"", yeah, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour, so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye

And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin' I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacay where it ain't no channels
But it's quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin' with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon' check myself in, again [Chorus: John Legend]

They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen the corner, now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh [Chorus: John Legend]
They say ""What's happenin'?""
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say, but they don't know
(They say, they say)
They don't know, oh"

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me ""Keep it pushin'!""
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga [Chorus: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)

You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
(Huh?) 
And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, [pow pow] drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right [Chorus: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
The home girls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esse's at arm reach; one West [Chorus: Jay Rock]
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)
I got the whole block bumpin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)"

And all my people that's—

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high

Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown [Chorus: Kanye West

This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas— [Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, 
Kanye West

Drug dealin' just to get by (
Yeah

Uh-huh, yeah

Yeah, yeah, ugh

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS,
 
some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""Rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say

We had love so strong, my heart couldn't take it
You took it in your hands and resuscitated
You said, ""Me and you against the world.""
You said, ""You and me forever, girl.""
I felt every cell fall in love with you, but
[Pre-Chorus]
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, 
but I know her name
, so see you later
[Chorus]
No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no, I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[Verse 2]
You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego
And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows
You said, ""I'm hangin' with the boys.""
You said, ""Workin' late to pay our bills.""
But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color [Pre-Chorus]
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your Playstation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later
[Chorus]
No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it

I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone

Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone
[Chorus]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
[Verse 2]
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead [Chorus]
But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk
[Bridge]
There will be times we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us
[Chorus]
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk [Verse 3]
Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he
Will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
""I'll be home so soon, I won't be late""
[Chorus]
He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk"

Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?

I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in

Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today

Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count

Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit

Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust [Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

Found myself in the city near Piccadilly

And I think I'll never come down
'Til a couple days go by

So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
Plus you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know it's pointless anyway

That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell [Chorus]

I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night [Verse 2]

Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children runnin'
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered

And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""

Used to people pulling me down, it ain't shit to me now

Threw out my phone, they can't get to me now
Keep it humble, but love to get big head
Bad bitches wanna fuck me, I get money instead
I mean what's rap without a little braggadocio?
Fuck people telling me to rap just how I'm supposed to
Most people wanna tell you what to do

But too scared
That's why they live vicariously through you

I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on, right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, I call to God
Selfishly, I keep it all for me
Usually, I don't wait too long, but for you, I might
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other [Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I don't wanna blink and see you out (Haha, I don't, no shade)
Pressed up on my body, like no doubt (No, no, no doubt, no doubt)
I don't want us movin' too fast (Fast, play your part, play your part)
That's a damn shame, but it gon' make your man insane
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
[Verse 3: Jon B]
Show me all the sugar I've been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you've got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing, when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
Obvious why we relatin', baby, just don't keep me waitin'
Come be my sugar, baby

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me

Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated
With that special brew
[Bridge]
So come and get me, let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart
Is on an all time low
So don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in
For a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading
For that stormy weather soon
[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood
So now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues [Interlude]

I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used
To my new exposure
So come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues

No one love you like I love ya

Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
Now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find

Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

Get you through the night

You'll always be alone

[Audience]
Yeah Kanye!
[Audience]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy…
[Kanye]
I figured if we were all quiet, I wouldn’t need a mic in here is that true?
[Audience]
Yeah.
[Kanye]
What is the number one thing that you guys want to change, because I want you all to [inaudible]?
[Audience]
(Crosstalk) Education.
[Kanye]
All right, get up here. [inaudible]. I want you to explain what the problem with education is.
[Summer]
The problem with education is they don’t stick up for minorities or people who aren’t in [inaudible]… [Kanye]
Hold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point.
[Audience]
Yes sir.
[Kanye]
[inaudible] then explain the issue.
[Summer]
My name is Summer [?]. I’d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color…
[Kanye]
I know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say ""Mm-hmm I feel that"" or ""Mm-hmm, I feel that"". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, ""I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves"" because I don’t love the word, I. Which I get the [inaudible].
When she says, We have completely expressed our point…[interrupted] who is that?
([We can’t hear you in the back])
You can’t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?
You see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we’re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.
[Kanye]
Summer…Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I’m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let’s go. [Summer]
Okay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they’re not teaching all of history. They’re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victor's perspective. That’s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we’re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it’ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It’ll teach people how to love each other.
There’s just so much wrong with education, some people don’t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don’t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don’t know that. There’s so much wrong with the education that we can’t keep up with…
[Kanye]
[inaudible], history.
Summer’s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.
[Summer]
Is that okay with you guys?
[Audience]
Yes!
[Kanye]
Wait a second. It doesn’t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that…
Quiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.
[Audience]
Yes!
[Kanye West]
So, me as the leader of the free world, it's time for the very first round. [Audience]
Yes!
[Kanye]
Inside of the very first rally. [crosstalk] I’ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.
[Summer]
Okay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn’t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he’s right. He’s Kanye West.
[inaudible] social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.
[Kanye]
Pause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.
Now Summer, go ahead.
[Summer]
So on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it’s in complete dismay.
Summer: (06:04)
There’s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there’s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone’s opinions. You don’t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that’s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.
Kanye West: (06:04)
Raise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.
Lauren: (06:04)
My name is Lauren McLeod.
Kanye West: (06:04)
This is Lauren McLeod.
Kanye West: (08:43)
I understand everyone is excited, it’s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God…we have someone who isn’t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally…Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? [inaudible 00:08:49]. Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we’re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it’s outside, you’d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn’t have the car directly outside, I’d have it on the other side of the street. So you’d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.
Kanye West: (09:32)
And that’s what social media…Quiet. That’s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I’m just walk…I don’t know where these bricks come from, but I’m going to use them.
Kanye West: (09:33)
Wait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?
Audience: (09:33)
No.
Kanye West: (09:33)
Did you put the bricks in the street? I’m not talking about the riots, I’m talking about the bricks in the 80s.
Audience: (09:33)
Oh.
Kanye West: (09:33)
We’re ready.
Lauren: (10:07)
Education is an important topic. Education…[inaudible 00:10:07]
Kanye West: (10:09)
We have no microphone.[inaudible 00:10:09]. You got it.
Lauren: (10:09)
Education starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we’re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don’t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There’s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.
Lauren: (10:42)
[inaudible 00:10:42], with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don’t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor’s, don’t feel comfortable going to vote, if you’re not able to go and vote?
Kanye West: (11:09)
Okay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I’ve got to [inaudible 00:11:09], I got to take everything quite serious. I’m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I’m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.
Kanye West: (11:26)
In Europe, there’s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.
Kanye West: (11:34)
Percocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this [inaudible 00:11:34] mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That’s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.
Kanye West: (12:34)
It said he was high as a mother-…No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next…No, because the next thing is the same thing. It’s a cycle. It’s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.
Kanye West: (12:55)
Uno memento…wait you come here for the next statement…you said can I…who’s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish…”Imma let you finish”
Lauren: (12:55)
Okay, well I have a statement about pride and how it’s different…
Kanye West: (12:55)
About pride.
Lauren: (13:41)
Yeah, different places in the United States are trying to [inaudible 00:13:41]. I grew up in [inaudible 00:13:41]. I repeat [inaudible 00:13:48]. [inaudible 00:13:47], they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn’t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. [inaudible 00:13:55], dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you’re back in class that day or the next day. It’s not a fair [inaudible 00:14:03]. If we don’t acknowledge that, nothing’s going to change. There’s still white people, black people, every single person [inaudible 00:14:09], truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we’re raised and the way we experience the world.
Lauren: (13:41)
And I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.
Kanye West: (14:51)
I understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I’m going to explain to you that Democrats ain’t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that’s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I’m going to split the Black votes.
Kanye West: (14:55)
This reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson’s character in Django? [crosstalk 00:14:59].
Kanye West: (14:58)
Stephen…Okay, right, right. I’m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don’t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven’t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that’s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.
Kanye West: (15:38)
The National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.
Kanye West: (16:03)
Talking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don’t see them. You don’t see the real power. You don’t know who’s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don’t know who’s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don’t know who’s the head of the boards.
Kanye West: (16:41)
In risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don’t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman…you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn’t start the movement. She couldn’t put the bricks in the streets. I don’t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.
Kanye West: (17:59)
We pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God’s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God’s people. There’s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God’s people. There’s not left, right, red, blue. That’s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I’ve never got next to someone who didn’t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we’re doing the same thing. We’re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let’s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I’m giving them the 15% royalty.
Kanye West: (19:15)
Wait a second, I don’t want to hear…I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I’m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God’s people. He sent pause
Kanye West: (20:24)
He set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.
Kanye West: (20:47)
I see you have your hands up, walk up here, you’re going to get your chance…yes you, young lady walk up here.
Kanye West: (21:05)
Now let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you…I’ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So…one more minute sir we can talk. I’m going to have my talk and then I’m going to do Planned Parenthood.
Kanye West: (21:09)
So…[inaudible 00:21:10] [inaudible 00:21:10] most likely speak Spanish here. No… we’re going to be [inaudible 00:21:26] most original languages and we, all these people,[inaudible 00:21:26]. So, and there are illegal, so called…, there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a…for the country that they’ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.
Kanye West: (21:47)
The statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don’t give a f***, I’m going to word it like [inaudible 00:22:16].
Kanye West: (22:19)
So my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don’t tell me I get it [inaudible 00:22:23] that sh** AIDS, that’s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I’m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.
Kanye West: (22:22)
So, I’m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God [inaudible 00:22:52]. Because I was having like a rapper’s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it’s a wrap, the baby’s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.
Kanye West: (23:19)
You already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I’m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I’m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we’re going to have this baby. I said we’re going to have this child.
Kanye West: (24:03)
I know people who are 50 years old that didn’t have children. They didn’t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I’ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.
Kanye West: (24:30)
You know who else protected a child? Who do you think might’ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.
Kanye West: (24:58)
[inaudible 00:24:58].
Audience: (24:58)
We love you Kanye.
Kanye West: (24:58)
I almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.
Kanye West: (28:50)
And then they said to me, You can’t, you can’t tell them about this story, you’re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a [inaudible 00:28:50] deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They’re going to run this. They’re going to try to tell you that I’m crazy, the world’s crazy. I love my daughter.
Kanye West: (28:50)
My idea…no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can’t have a Plan A option?
Audience: (28:50)
No.
Kanye West: (28:50)
Calm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.
Speaker 1: (28:51)
What about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness? [inaudible 00:28:51] What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you’re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?
Kanye West: (28:51)
Now everyone be quiet so you can hear us. [inaudible 00:27:18]. Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.
Speaker 1: (28:51)
Single moms with no family. Single moms…
Kanye West: (28:51)
Exactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. [inaudible 00:27:47]. How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there’s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking…you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.
Audience: (28:51)
Yes.
Speaker 1: (28:51)
Kanye, I love you. [inaudible 00:28:18]. You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don’t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don’t think we should get rid of abortions.
Kanye West: (28:51)
Let me tell you. The Bible says…
Speaker 1: (28:56)
The Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.[inaudible 00:28:56].
Kanye West: (29:10)
When I said I had…[inaudible 00:29:10].[inaudible 00:29:21]. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren’t good enough as they saw it in the world.
Kanye West: (30:06)
Amber started crying when she saw that. That’s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I’m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn’t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the…I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce [inaudible 00:30:35], I mean of getting an abortion.
Kanye West: (30:39)
I understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I’ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can’t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.
Kanye West: (31:16)
People always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won’t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I’m saying is, we understand, we’re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions.
Kanye West: (32:03)
Break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says “Hey, I can do this stuff.”
Kanye West: (32:24)
When a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it’s because I can do that. [crosstalk 00:32:39] So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, “He compared abortion to gold teeth.” Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.
Georgia: (33:00)
What are you? Nothing? [crosstalk 00:33:00]
Kanye West: (33:07)
I am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason… What’s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.
Speaker 2: (33:18)
Why’d you delete it?
Kanye West: (33:24)
Because I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I’m saying is, I’ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone… In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in [inaudible 00:33:43] looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.
Kanye West: (34:00)
What I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why… You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example. [crosstalk 00:34:23] Does anyone know [crosstalk 00:34:23] TMZ.
Speaker 2: (34:23)
F*** TMZ!
Kanye West: (34:23)
[crosstalk 00:34:23] quiet down, right? So let’s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that’s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?
Audience: (34:35)
Yeah.
Kanye West: (34:37)
Okay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby’s mama and y’all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y’all get in an argument and she says, “My house, my choice. I’m going to kill your child.” You know what I’m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don’t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I’m saying? I’m not here to [crosstalk 00:35:22].
Kanye West: (35:23)
I care that it’s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it’s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much [inaudible 00:35:31] because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don’t know, I’m like an employee [crosstalk 00:35:39] this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. [crosstalk 00:35:50]
Kanye West: (35:34)
How do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?
Speaker 2: (35:34)
When we steal.
Georgia: (35:34)
When we lie.
Kanye West: (35:34)
When we steal. How else?
Georgia: (35:34)
When we lie.
Kanye West: (35:34)
Lie.
Audience: (35:34)
Cheat.
Kanye West: (36:06)
When we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land. [crosstalk 00:36:25] I don’t think the last… [inaudible 00:36:29] a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.
Audience: (36:53)
[inaudible 00:36:53] Talk up! [inaudible 00:37:02] [crosstalk 00:37:12]
Kanye West: (37:19)
Wait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I’m over. And if I’m over right now, guess what else is over. The country’s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn’t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.
Georgia: (38:04)
I just think my [inaudible 00:38:04]. I don’t think we should say [crosstalk 00:38:15].
Kanye West: (38:20)
Let me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for [crosstalk 00:38:31]. Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what’s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. [crosstalk 00:39:11]
Kanye West: (39:14)
Maximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that. [crosstalk 00:39:20] Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that’s worked five [crosstalk 00:39:29]. We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. [crosstalk 00:39:57]
Kanye West: (39:57)
When you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, “Bro.” And then what else did I say? I said, “Listen to the [crosstalk 00:40:21], bro. Listen to the kids, bro.” And are we running in 2020?
Audience: (40:29)
Yep. Yeah.
Kanye West: (40:31)
Okay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place? [crosstalk 00:41:02] But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she’s saying I don’t have the funding… Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. [crosstalk 00:41:12]
Kanye West: (41:12)
Let me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, “I’m about a [crosstalk 00:41:13] thousand dollar stipend,” but that’s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, “Okay, this person is mentally ill. This person is [crosstalk 00:41:41].” Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It’s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can’t fix things. Money’s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, all the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can’t do and what God will do. [crosstalk 00:42:28]
Kanye West: (42:27)
One second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes. [crosstalk 00:42:40] wait a second. You need to hear this. [crosstalk 00:42:54] this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?
Kanye West: (43:19)
We got, we’re going to have to, you’re very [crosstalk 00:43:20]. Come up here, you’re third. [crosstalk 00:43:20] I’ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Wait a second. I must [crosstalk 00:43:20] that I did smoke a little bit last night. [crosstalk 00:43:20] Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free. [crosstalk 00:44:26] Light up right now. [crosstalk 00:44:40] Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You’ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What’s your name, sir? Gary, you’re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that [crosstalk 00:44:55] Michael Jackson’s home. Oh, I’m sorry. [crosstalk 00:45:00]
Audience: (43:19)
I love Michael!
Kanye West: (43:19)
Oh, do we still love Michael?
Audience: (45:11)
Yeah! [crosstalk 00:45:11]
Kanye West: (45:11)
Do y’all love Cosby? Y’all love Bill Cosby?
Audience: (45:17)
Yeah! [crosstalk 00:45:17]
Kanye West: (45:17)
Be quiet. He’s talking about opioids.
Gary: (45:17)
I want to talk about opioids and [inaudible 00:45:39].
Audience: (45:17)
Speak up!
Gary: (45:17)
It’s like the treatment. We’re addicted to the treatment.
Kanye West: (45:55)
And by the way, we’re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y’all looked up what y’all likes are when you post something? That’s a form of treatment. Y’all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that “getting treated”. When y’all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don’t even know who that person is.
Audience: (46:13)
Nobody!
Kanye West: (46:14)
That’s the person that’s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to [crosstalk 00:46:14]
Gary: (46:14)
I’m saying we’re addicted to the treatment. They’re trying to [crosstalk 00:46:14].
Kanye West: (46:14)
What I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have [crosstalk 00:46:40] more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There’s a solution for big pharm. There’s a solution with that. I tell you this, I’m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity. [crosstalk 00:47:00] Okay, Aisha’s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.
Kanye West: (48:00)
Because I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about…no I don’t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain’t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?
Kanye West: (48:07)
No that’s what I’m talking about. I told…don’t step up but what’s your name? Tell the people what your name is. [inaudible 00:48:07].
Kanye West: (48:07)
Hey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I’ll tell you what.
Kanye West: (48:07)
Real talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. [inaudible 00:49:18].People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China…I actually couldn’t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.
Kanye West: (49:50)
When I talked to the billionaire…it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It’s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and [inaudible 00:50:54] through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said “Okay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?” Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There’s a reason…would you agree that there’s a reason why there’s never been a class on that?
Kanye West: (51:14)
Because ever time I talk, you’re directly behind me saying something. What I’m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I’ve told you, the whole time I’m talking to a hundred people, two hundred…it started with a hundred people it’s down to [inaudible 00:52:24] people. And every time that you make a comment [inaudible 00:52:32].
Kanye West: (52:53)
And you are adding to the attention of them not understanding [inaudible 00:52:53]. That’s what I’m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?
Shiloh: (53:36)
I have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the [inaudible 00:53:36] free of slaves and how [inaudible 00:53:39]. Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about [inaudible 00:53:45].
Kanye West: (54:36)
I will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I’m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don’t think I know how to listen? [inaudible 00:55:17]. No they know everyone’s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don’t gap me. On God.
Kanye West: (59:38)
I appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible…you… disrespecting [inaudible 00:56:05].
Kanye West: (59:38)
You know what…you know what’s so funny? [inaudible 00:56:33]. We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That’s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it’s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don’t own anything in it. You stay looking bad…I believe we’re all beautiful. It’s not about how we look. It’s about our hearts. It’s about what’s in our souls.
Kanye West: (59:38)
Now, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that’s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.
Kanye West: (59:38)
I’m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don’t even know who you are.
Kanye West: (59:38)
400 years is related to the bible. [inaudible 00:58:19] African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say “Jesus” anytime we want. But we got educated, we’re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.
Kanye West: (59:38)
You probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.
Kanye West: (59:39)
Give me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don’t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There’s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be [inaudible 00:59:58] black church. That’s some true sh**.
Kanye West: (01:00:19)
Everybody’s family…everybody has everybody. Everybody’s got some holier than thou worth. [inaudible 01:00:19]. Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle…everybody. Everybody’s family…we all are imperfect human beings [inaudible 01:00:36]. Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I’m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say “This is us.” I do not…I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.
Kanye West: (01:01:12)
That was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I’m going to win in 2020. Out."

You're simply not in the pink, my dear
To be honest, you haven't got a clue

I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck

I'm coming down with a fever

This kettle is boiling over

Ayo, what's the deal? Mind too active, can't sit still

That's a sci-fi reference, nerd shit my preference
Family is the only thing that mattеrs, bitch, I'm Stefan
I can't believе at first sight you thought I was Steve

Misdirected, inheaded in my direction, intelligent  and I'm tellin' it
Droppin' heavy shit that's still heaven sent

 utmost, definite, deadin' it
'Fore niggas can't fathom who they effin' with
Raw, no condom, you still can't come correct with it
I represent a specialist of artists who never charted
But never parted, often regarded as the hardest
As the autumn falls in, tell the wind I never fail
Leaves do

Don't tell, another cup of XXL, trouble for sale
Back bustin' a couple of shells, for Durell

Back then, it was a film per album plus a couple mill'
Plug pulled the rug from up under my wheels
Humbly kill, stomach and pills, fumblin' bills, shit
Killed the player like Jada did Will Smith

You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah)

What these bitches want from a nigga?
[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days
 I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin' [Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you get at me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me [Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"

How could you look at me

[Verso 1]
Se me acaba el argumento y la metodología
Cada vez que se aparece frente a mí tu anatomía
Porque este amor ya no entiende de consejos, ni razones
Se alimenta de pretextos y le faltan pantalones
[Pre-Coro]
Este amor no me permite estar en pie
Porque ya hasta me ha quebrado los talones
Aunque me levante volveré a caer
Si te acercas nada es útil para esta inútil
[Coro]
Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace
Otra cosa más que amarte
Pienso en ti día y noche
Y no sé cómo olvidarte
[Verso 2]
Cuántas veces he intentado enterrarte en mi memoria
Y aunque diga ""Ya no más"" es otra vez la misma historia
Porque este amor siempre sabe hacerme respirar profundo
Ya me trae por la izquierda y de pelea con el mundo [Pre-Coro]
Si pudiera exorcizarme de tu voz
Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
Si pudiera arrancarme el corazón
Y esconderme para no sentirme nuevamente

Ojerosa, flaca, fea, desgreñada
Torpe, tonta, lenta, necia, desquiciada
Completamente descontrolada
Tú te das cuenta y no me dices nada
Ves que se me ha vuelto la cabeza un nido
Donde solamente tú tienes asilo
Y no me escuchas lo que te digo
Mira bien lo que vas a hacer conmigo [Coro]
Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
Torpe, traste y testaruda
Es todo lo que he sido
Por ti me he convertido
En una cosa que no hace

Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we've been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you're feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't, see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you're fine
'Cause I know you're not, so don't even try it
And what? We gon' live in this life full of pain
'Til we're eighty and when we'll get up and say we regretted our lives?

Catch it and hoping to cut off its wings
But that ain't gon' happen

I don't remember, 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards, but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we're breathing but we're not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If they only knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you're thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Then why don't you fix it, 'cause I'm getting tired!
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See? You find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic, you don't know what you're doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost! [Chorus: Andreas Moss]

6665,3397,Breathe In Breathe Out,Kanye West,"[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I gotta 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (Kweli)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped, I'd say somethin' significant
But now, I'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named ""Cinnamon,"" 
more chips than Pentium
""What you gon' buy next?"" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryna spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back, like, ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean, twelve platinum chains—was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me, dawg?
Sing along with me, y'all [Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out (
Ugh
)
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's

When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now, even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'
She asked, ""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive, she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand; let me help you with a plan
While he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga
Give 
me
 some head—that'll really piss him off [Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GS'ses was ambidextrous
Could've sworn her breast-eses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl, you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time—you gotta breathe! [Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! 
Breathe in, br
eathe o
ut
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like ""Peace out!""

Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (Out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (Love!)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone 
(Ah!)
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder 
(Ah, ah!)
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her 
(Ah!)
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo!""
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place (Ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory though (Ah!)
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door

Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle

Meanwhile you're chasin' her""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from 
The Wire
's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behaviour
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, 
now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab""
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, ""Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*
Car crashes
*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*
Message sound

Wait, ""dinner at eight""? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the— [Outro: Wayne Fontana]

Cause they know I'm the over the wall type of dog
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammy Sosa
Bubble gum cards and all the posters
Y'all know, how I roast ya when it's time to compete
On the field, on the court, over any hot beat
Or break, and you know it when you see your clone
And right now that's all I see goin' on, holla at me
Game time, all I think about is bringin' home the trophy
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home
Cause I don't know lose too much
Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all
When I'm playin' Hardball (that's right)

Keep pitchin', I'm in the kitchen makin' radio rock
It's usually preferred, I be choosy with all my words
Throwin' eggs at them chickenheads, beggin' on the curb
Direct from my burb, a fast baller with a curve
Have her slidin' home, tellin her friends just in the third
I'm sure ya done heard, who I'm doin' and what I'm doin'
What's false and what's true and (girl listen)
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGwire
That other kid was just a Mark, so I made him retire
See we all got a base, and we hold our own
But when I - come up to bat, we all goin' come home
And our fans cheers us on cause they know what the drill is
Goin, out of the field into your automobile
And I hope it ain't your Range Rover that you spent your change over
I'm in the dugout with my tongue out player game over [Chorus: Sammie]

And I call mami sweetheart, she call me sweet daddy
And she gladly loves the way that daddy bat it, yeah baby

No, it ain't black or white, it's all of the colors
That I only just discovered
Now I'm California sober
California sober
[Bridge]
Trading judgment for freedom
Found somethin' new to believe in
Somethin' inside of me screaming
""Don't be so hard on yourself""
Look up, somethin' has shifted
My heavy spirit is lifted
I found myself
[Chorus]
I'm California sober
It doesn't have to mean the growin' part is over
No, it ain't black or white, it's all of the colors (Yeah, yeah)
That I only just discovered
Now I'm California sober
California sober
I, California sober, I
California sober"

We couldn't turn it around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I tried
You don't believe it, we do this every time
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flames 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echo

I'll shove a gun in your grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you're breathing
And you'll be leaving the receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us? We'll be waiting on eight corners
Swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floating around, drowned, faced-down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull-up to the Seven Mile drive through
At McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out of his Eddie Bauer
When it drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading - I won't die, I'm never leaving
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through them, put the heat to them
Be careful you might get what you ask for
That's what you false ballers get mugged and gagged for
Your life flashing in front of your eyes in fast forward
Dearly departed, I don't even listen to artists
I'm pissing the farthest, and I'm also hitting the hardest
I'm very intelligent
Compare me to cameras
I flash, and shoot what I see, and steady developing
I fly you out of your whip with one try of the trigger
Out of your clique, ain't one nigga out of his shit
You gotta be kidding, bring all of them niggas
They all gotta be hit quick, and they all gotta be hitten
It's not a game, and I ain't playing
Yo if I ain't lived it, did it, or seen it, then I ain't saying
I put a hole right in your chest
Stick a knife in your soul
Then take your life after taking your death
I'm nice!
That ain't even counting the endless bars
Friends with scars, wondering which Benz is ours
Pretending to ball could even be the ending of y'all
The minute you fall, my criminals will finish you off
I argue with no one
You got a gun? Alright show one
If you ain't got heart now, you ain't gon' just grow one [Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm keeping it raw, illegal like Malik and Jamal
'Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flipping off the police while I'm leaping a wall
Take a bunch of Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
You're lucky this little punks still breathing at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink your teeth in your jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
This lethal assault, is giving you a reason to stall
I'm cocking this deuce-deuce and I'm squeezing it off
At the first burp and a fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasing a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9""]
I'm gonna give it to you straight this time
Lace this bong
Bring it to your face until the Jakes respond
Guard y'all shit
I don't care how hard y'all hit
I got cats with bats you wouldn't play hardball with
I splatter intestines quick, before you can blast
Or handle your weapon, you'll get stabbed in a matter of seconds
We ain't worried about threats cause God got us
We popping Cris, y'all sipping Moet by-products
I ain't scared to die, let's blast, it's gonna be either
If you both die then your casket is gonna be deeper
Yo, you ain't a Don
You don't even know what beef is
What you competing with, our hittin' make concrete give
Yo I came out
Naked at birth, making it worse
Making a verse sacred and shaking the Earth
Niggas got plenty opinions about Royce
But they ain't got a voice
I'm doper than them, so they ain't got a choice
Niggas be playing battle-battle
Not understanding themselves
They babble-babble that's why they stay on the shelves
Playing yourself, I'm promising threats to test y'all
Keep doing this rap shit until UPS calls
I see why you must hate me
I'm sharp enough to cut gravy
It's just crazy, niggas is such babies
Real as they come, dancing
Killing for fun, advancing
Healing my thumb, killing for fun
Cock, squeeze and make every nigga freeze in here
Stop breathing, there better be some cheese in here
If there's any MCs in here, I hope you read me clear
You seeing peace, beef with the C's in here
Yo you ain't fly
I got shit that you can't buy
You can't lie, you drink St. Ides and fake high
Take pie, try to flip it
You don't nothing about that shit
If was you I wouldn't risk it [Verse 5: Eminem]
I wouldn't risk it...
Rappers get hit with this verbal biscuit
Hey yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Keep the same beat, keep the same beat, keep the same beat
It goes like this, yo
My attitude is worse than N.W.A.'s was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does
You see me standing outside of your building screaming
Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just trying to get my porno career started
Every place and event.. (been there, done that)
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson one: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two: Face 'em and diss 'em
Don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus
And put yours on the owner's table
Lesson four: Know you heard this before:
""Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't
Givin you shit bitch - don't even bother asking me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spitting
Cause I'm always shitting when I'm rapping like Master P
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fucking Aaliyah
I splish splash while I'm taking a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fucking your wife in the ass
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass And it's like that, and it's like that
[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9""]
It don't stop
5-9, Slim Shady yo
The rap auctioneer, spitting out double figures
For fans to repeat, handling heat
The Commander in Chief, I should've been banned from the streets
Flee after I stab an MC with twin crutches
You've been had by the phantom of beef
Release when the paper and pen touches
While y'all talking
My venomous rap splits
Get your ass kicked punk
Your kind get offed often
80 niggas deep with heat at the mall walking
You'll either get shot with all barkers
Or get knocked upside your head with big blocks
Till you spit teeth
You're all soft and up shit's creek in a long coffin
I get work without a single fiend involved
I'm married to the mob, I mean for real, ring and all
Basically that means I ain't your average rap nigga
You'll get slapped and thrown in the back of an Ac(ura) bigger
With the latch cracked, trunk open
So you can look up at the stars
Fill your pockets with plastic explosives
Drive to cover, detonate the bomb
Blow you up with the car and flee the scene to cop another
Morph right into the physical form of your spirit
In front of your eyes, and make you battle yourself
Like Shang Tsung with wisdom in the brilliance of a million disciples
Equipped with a right hook to split a building
The pure repper of the African race
Sent here to knock you off your square and put you back in your place
Babylon battalion, holding your engineer ransom
For your master, so I can sabotage your album
[Verse 7: Eminem]
Yo, weed lacer, '97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loc shit, some fed up with the being broke shit
I’m not to joke with, bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Having a coke fit, going through withdrawls daily
Shoot-up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted, I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking, talking about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; every drug in the book; I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me sticking you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, crystal-meth manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boosting Nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back bitch
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasing dips – take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping ‘em and trapping ‘em in abusive relationships
Fuck up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Cut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m fucked up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of this shit, 
what’s Dr. Kevorkian’s phone number?
[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9""]
It's like this right?
Bust it
You get laced by the gun, in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the tongue, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative flusher to enemies
The impact will be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black, poised since birth
Birth? Tore the womb up
To hit the Earth like an asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Any nigga can say fuck me and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man this is hot, I'm out of my shit
From the bottom I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise and eclipse, and occasional trips to the beer store
And switch-up, the breed of MC to stick a bitch up
Bigger and speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I crushed all y'all, now you want a collaboration
But fuck that, you stepped up, so I'm gonna fuck your rep up
Tear the rest up, with every joint that I press up
Handling heat and ammo, bullets passing me by
Challenging me to battle? Man, you asking to die
Narrow off niggas, squeeze a grenade until it's dissolved
Bite the barrel of a revolver and spin it
Nigga forget it, I earned it
I kill you then come to your funeral and strangle you to confirm it
Minds carry malaria, sick
Ask niggas who the best is, you'll hear 5-9 in every area
Crushing your head, hunting you dead
You ain't nice
I battled you before, I don't remember nothing you said
You was wack, I was gonna quit on it till I thought
My dick is big enough for all of y'all niggas to get on it
Making you high off of the smoke, often you're cold
Making y'all join that big hip-hop nation in the sky
And it's easy believe me, you better have been fronting
When you said you was hot, cause you couldn't please me if you was begging me
[Verse 9: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Who came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O that I sniffed of cane
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each others' name
Run in the ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers Lane, to the night you were thought of
And cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'm gonna throw a head-butt so hard, it'll knock us both out"

Ha, I kill me,
 
this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word ""fucking"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, 
I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal

I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming,
 I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine [Chorus]

I want it all, I want it all, I push so hard, I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet, I taste it
So, are you lonely? 'Cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment, your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now
[Chorus]
When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?
[Verse 2]
All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side (On the side)
When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night
When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad, I got room service
Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
What your life like? Need a lifeline right now
Ninety-nine nights, tryna get my mind right now
Life is sour, even when I'm in the limelight now
But I try somehow [Chorus]
When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?
[Outro]

Just tell me, who's to blame for this?

Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car
Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow
The way you walk I thought you was a model

Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty; that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety (Anxiety)
Walk slow through the fire

Feeling the world go against us ('Gainst us)
So we put the world on our shoulders

We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up 'cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion

No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy

Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, 
I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, 
naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain [Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain
[Outro: Sam Harris]

Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain

For more pain

I'd over look your condescending tone if you heed the gravity in mine
[Pre-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner
Ain't no telling who my money for
Got my dope from cross the border
Got my home on Figueroa, ain't no telling where that pussy go
[Chorus]
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news
My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape
Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking
Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing
Better act like you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget
And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic
My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging
With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it [Chorus]
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

I ain't asking, I'm telling you, bitch

Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep carless, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't asking, I'm telling you [Chorus]
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

Will you sell that pussy for me?

Did all the favors, they never repaid me

Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
 
While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her

(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

You got me thinking things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from saying, ""I miss you""
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself
You don't control me [Chorus]

Laying in my bed, I'm just staring at the ceiling, baby
I just wanna know if you can feel what I'm feeling, baby
Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately
Yeah, deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm a man of my word, girl believe that
I'm a closed book but somehow you learn to read that
Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Girl I wake up in the morning', all I can think of is you
[Chorus]
I got you on my mind, baby (Oh yeah, yeah)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby (Don't you know, don't you know it, yeah)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby (Got you on my mind, baby, I got you on my mind, my mind)
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

But how can I be glad?
Now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew

The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in

The darkness and sadness
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow

Like you always do
I just kiss your cheek

What I tell you (you, you)

Kanye:
 OK, dope. You still got the Nashville number?
Taylor:
 I still have the Nashville area code but I had to change it
Kanye:
 
For all my south side niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.
Taylor:
 
I'm, like, this close to overexposure.
Kanye:
 Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.
Taylor
:
 I know! I mean it's like a compliment kind of.
Kanye:
 What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.
Taylor:
 That's sweet.
Kanye:
 I want things that make you feel good. I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.
Taylor:
 Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way.
Taylor:
 And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice!
Kanye:
 Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.
Taylor:
 Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!
Taylor:
 …things without like even asking or seeing if I'd be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.
Taylor:
 I'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.
Taylor:
 And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and it's the most Instagram likes I've ever gotten.
Kanye:
 
Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know.
Taylor:
 Yea. I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, that's a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…
Taylor:
 You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor:
 It doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor:
 … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, I'm always gonna respect you.
Taylor:
 And I'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.
Kanye:
 Thank you too.
Taylor:
 And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.
Taylor:
 You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.
Taylor:
 …awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! It's more provocative to say, Might still have sex.
Taylor:
 …it's not. 
It doesn't matter to me. There's not one that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't.
2020 Leak
Kanye:
 —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.
Taylor:
 What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.
Kanye:
 The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.
Taylor:
 What does it say? [nervous laughter]
Kanye:
 It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?
Taylor:
 Yeah…
Kanye:
 Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.
Taylor:
 Well, is it gonna be mean?
Kanye:
 No, I don’t think it’s mean.
Taylor:
 Okay, then let me hear it.
Kanye:
 Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?
Taylor:
 Okay.
Kanye:
 
So it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” [chuckles]
Taylor:
 [chuckles] That’s not mean.
Kanye:
 Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”
Taylor:
 Oh my [laughs]. I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. 
I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not.
 Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.
Kanye:
 Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.
Taylor:
 You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?
Kanye:
 Yeah.
Taylor:
 
I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.
Kanye:
 Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.
Taylor:
 I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of [laughs].
Kanye:
 I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. 
She was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”
Taylor:
 That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…
Kanye:
 
Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—
Taylor:
 That’s sweet.
Kanye:
 —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He’s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.”
Taylor:
 Why are people saying you’re bullying Nike?
Kanye:
 Because on “Facts” I said like, “Yeezy, Nike out here bad, they can’t give shit away.”
Taylor:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that’s just what you do though.
Kanye:
 [laughs]
Taylor:
 [laughs] I mean, I wouldn’t say that it’s like possible to bully a company like Nike where—I mean, um, yeah, I mean …"

You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young, so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died, you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it
That you succame to yours and mine, I survived it
You ran the streets, I nine-to-fived it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
Then I blew up, to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe, I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it [Chorus: Eminem]

And you don't even call no more?

'Fore I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with, I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming out of the bar with her, stumbling, half-drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fuckin' other niggas
Must've hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people
Like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player, the one that's changing is you [Chorus: Eminem]

Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?

We don't talk much, not anymore
Broken bottles and slammin' doors

Say we care about each other
I know life took us far away
But I still dream 'bout the good old days
When we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other

Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me? [Verse 2]
Yeah, I miss all the times we had
Can't forget what you can't get back
And you can't find it in another
Man, time, it ain't your lover
I don't care what you thought before
I'll be there anytime you call
Don't you ever call another
No need to call another
[Pre-Chorus]
And I start to wonder, wonder
If I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow
Dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright
[Verse 1: Logic]
You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means
And finally attain your dreams?
On the come up, where they run up from the world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what I mean
Most these rappers ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' ill is a disease, it's the onset
And it don't matter where you at, if you white or if you black
If you rich or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'ma use this power to paint a picture of unity
And yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like it's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

Feelin' blessed like I'm at mass, yeah, I'm comin' for that ass
Game been broken for too long, so I guess I am the cast
Left my Section 8 crib, finally found some greener grass
So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past
This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder
Oh no, it can't get no better
And you know, we know we do it for the children
I never thought I'd see the day I made a million
Couple dozen later, feel like everybody feel 'em
I ain't mean to boast in that last line
But countin' money's always been my favorite pastime
Especially with a past like mine
Drugs in the household
, 
never had a hand to hold
Even when I was homeless in the blisterin' cold, but I made it out
And if I can, you can, no doubt, I know—

 I'ma do it like I never did it

 I'ma have the courage to go out and get it

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here

Only thing I know, it's gonna be alright

Everybody tryna kill my light
Only thing I know it's gonna be alright (one day)

Only thing I know it's gonna be alright (one day)
Keep tryna tell myself in the morning things will be better (one day)
I keep tryna tell myself that tomorrow's different weather

Never been a people person, always been a people's person
Know how to get a person, don't know how to keep a person, yeah
But you know everybody need somebody
And everybody ain't gon' be somebody
I mean, it's been like twenty years since my mother has seen somebody
I'm convinced that she thinks that's it's too late or somethin'
I should try and set her up on a date or somethin'
You deserve love, how long are you gon' wait for somethin'?
Nah, we gon find you someone doin' some
Someone rich and single, is Lionel Richie single?
Haha, okay, I'm jokin', I'm kiddin', I'm playin'

Don't worry 'bout the rest of me (Oh)

I started believin' that crazy shit she told me
Not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
Then I got bored, because fightin' is boring
And she was gone soon as I started stallin'
I don't want it except for when I want it
And even then I beat myself up for it
That's when you hear me say I'm movin' on from it
But it's obviously something else that I want from it
And then that's how she goes about it
It's hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
I'm textin' and callin' like that's my true callin'
And the only time that she's really talking
Is when you she tells me about myself like that's what's important
Startin' things over nothin', that shit is overwhelmin'
Her main problem is she always think I'm up to somethin'
And, shit, talking 'bout it make me wanna fuckin' call her
Reverse psychology, whatever you call it
But to answer the question, yeah, I think we're happy
We're always reunited, that's a good thing, I guess
We're always startin' over, that shit always seems excitin'
I don't know, I guess it's yet to be seen
She's busy doin' her and I'm out here chasin' the dream
Honestly, we say a lot of things that we don't mean

At times I thought a nigga wouldn’t ever see ya

I was wilin' with my strap, I was totin' ninas
You know I pull up in the jag I want you in a bimmer
Tell my momma you my one and only girl I need ya
Tell my baby, you my lady, I just wanna please ya
I be pullin' on yo hair when I be stroking deeper
I know you don’t like that smell when I be smoking reefer
You my favorite alphabet, they just wanna be ya

I can take you to a place you thought you'd never go
I can do some things for you, you thought impossible
Man sometimes I just be thinkin' I won't ever make it
Cause I be goin' through a lot of situations
I'ma keep it real with you, girl I'm infatuated
I'ma show you that I love you I will never fake it
I remember drinking lean, living like the matrix

Girl you know I'm from the streets, yeah I'm a project baby
Wonderin' would you stay with me if I don’t ever make it [Chorus: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya

I'm forever your lil' hustler
You so bad I don't want to see you fuckin' with no busta
To see your face again It got me captivated
Keep it real with me what you been doing lately
I need a jump right in that pussy, I feel like a virgin
After you drop that neck I'm gonna drop some verses
I ain't seen you in so long it got me feelin' nervous
I'm sorry for leaving you, ain't do that shit on purpose

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same
[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same [Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before [Outro]

I did it today, I made myself say
And I take back my tears, my sight, my love
No more does your magic work, on my heart
No more will your words ever tear me apart
I know now for certain, nothing's burning anymore
[Skit: Tom Hansen in

""I love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh.""
[Verse 1]
I can feel it now, it's coming soon
It is my world, my sun and moon
Once upon a time, this world was love
But now I know this is everything that I've dreamed of
So take it slow, speed it up
Every time I see you I just want to beat it up
Maybe not, but that's a lie
C'mon baby girl, there ain't no need to cry
Just let me go or let me know
Why the hell you wanna stick around fo'
Arms length, that's all you do
Don't get too close, that is the rule
I remember when I met her back in high school
Science class, sitting on the stool
Now I'm feeling—feeling like a fool
'Cause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel
Or maybe not, just very lovely
No matter what she says I know she still loves me
So can I love?—I've already asked
Who would've known matters of the heart
Would be such a task? [Skit: Tom Hansen in 
[500] Days of Summer

""I hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. And I hate the way she sounds when she laughs.""
[Verse 2]
She used to be my girl
But now she just a girl I'm fucking
She used to mean the world to me
But now that world is nothing
I would've put a ring on that finger but I couldn't afford it
So I laced it with ribbon, she adored it
Sometimes I wonder if she thinks of me
But my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively
How could the pussy be that good?
'Cause my feelings involved
'Til my shorty evolved and her feelings dissolved
But that's what happens when you find them young
Treat them like royalty, and they will run
Searching the world for perfect love and realize you're the one
But they fucked up cause now that shit is done
This is a letter to the woman of my dreams
Love what she brings
So listen baby girl cause everything ain't what it seems
You either know me now or I'mma meet you after fame
But one thing's for sure, your life will never be the same
'Cause you're gonna be my wife and my mistress
So understand now I can't be there for every Christmas
I love you more than anything, but I could never risk this
On stage living life, while you're forced to miss this"

These memories fill my mind

You know I love that cologne

Compton most wanted, haunted by the ghost of the dead
Climbing out the casket, with a bullet in the head
All blue, all red, smothers every corner
Catch 'em while they're young like the symptoms of pneumonia
Good 'ol California, killa' California
Where the violence lives, and the peace remains homeless
Killers off the leash, at the mouth, they be foaming
Mad dog mad dog, my goonies be some mad dogs
I'm in the booth zoning
Like 28 grams, of the good yams
Fiends line up in the morning
I'm cloning, greatness
My words made of fire like I'm rhyming about satan
I could burn through some braces
If I had 'em
This is the return of the dragon
I'm not talking about, Bruce Lee
I'm talking about, true heat
And it look like you got cold feet
Step into the flame and I might rekindle your name
(laughing)
Point blank range, as I take aim, at success
Put a bullet in the brain, then one more, in the chest
I'm not thinking about no vest, that is not a factor
I rip through that like I rip through a rapper
I'm not a rapper, I am a raptor
Dinosaur climbing on, everything that I perform
Mayhem, chaos, they pray i, fall
Victim of a fight, which is a gunslinging brawl
But I'm all in all aware, that I'm rare
Like a flying saucer hovin' through the air
Kendrick don't have a spare, meaning there's
No two alike, you can bet it, and I guarantee I'm right
Like a freeway exit, 
I hope you get the message
Before your T-Mobile lose service
And don’t log off AIM on purpose, you nervous
Ain't you, I'm ready to spank you
Discipline the disobedient hang 'em like Willy Lynch
Don't fuck with me I'm a furnace, burning, turn this mothafucka' inside out like
Daddy mac, mac,
 daddy's back with a brand new bag
And I'm talking about, mo' money pussy and pistols
Students please get out your pencils
I'm about to break down the principles of the game
Don't complain because, it could be much worse
Whenever you took an L, know that, you could be taking a hearse
Ask you first, don't trust no skirt because bitches are the biggest liars
You playing with that you playing with fire
Burn (echoes)
Straight from the belly of the beast
Break it to the police
Said he put it on me
I'm a ride til my wheels fall off with a G
Ride with the P, 89 creep
On him like a ninja, you entered the warzone
Your home Get bombed on, like an iraqi, and the policy
A guerilla warfare, that nothing is fair
We playin for keeps, no food no sleep
I'm a warrior the coroner going to have to come and get him
Put him under the streets, and I guarantee
I hit 'em where it hurts, I'm a lurk where he sleeps
His alarm clock beep, I be right there
Gun then knife, dead kids, dead wife
Dead bedrock head shot, I'm a hit him twice
Then clear out the block, until there's no mo' life there
Top dawg ENT, bitch we right here
We ain't runnin'
We be gunnin'
Niggas talk alot but they don't say nothin'
Chop 'em up, slice 'em up, he a cooked onion
Shake 'em down, break 'em down, throw 'em in a dungeon
Don't wanna brawl with 5-6 hog
I'm a beast when I bark, every skyship fall
Ground shall break, part the seas and the greatest lakes
Anarchy is taking place, turn gorillas to bathing apes
I'm a gorilla in every state

4643,2146412,"To Apple, Love Taylor",Taylor Swift,"I write this to explain why I’ll be holding back my album, 1989, from the new streaming service, Apple Music. I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries.
I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.
This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.
These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.
I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.
Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.
But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
(
Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me
)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
Lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is Black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you could see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in '04
Started HiiiPower
 because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (
Ooh
)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope

Daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to Kendrick

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV

What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation

We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversatin', she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies, apologize, the thirst real
When she hear this, thinkin' to herself, ""Damn, this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs

Mill in cash on the 'Gram, they trendin' Meech home

We'll be coming back for you one day
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
[Refrain]
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same? [Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
[Bridge]
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day"

9653,2434551,Therapy Session,NF,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got off stage like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of 'em pulled me aside and said
""We never met, but I swear that you know who I am
I've been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people, don't think that I can
But I got that 
Mansion
 CD on rotation
That's real for me, Nate, you do not understand""
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slittin' they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertainin'
Hearin' these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent—you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me, huh?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh?
You want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask? For real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you'd slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
These are the parts of my life they don't never see, woo!
I am aware, it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expected
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session, huh? [Chorus]
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session
[Verse 2]
This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama (Yeah!)
Said her dad is abusive
Apparently, he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it, right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hittin' her harder, that's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
'Magine someone looking at you
And sayin' your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras (Nah!)
You see me walk on these stages
But have no idea what I'm dealing with after it, nah!
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm tryin' to deal with depression
I'm tryin' to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm lookin' out at this crowd full of people I know I affected? Agh!
I got some things in my life (My life)
I know I should let 'em go (Let 'em go)
Let me jot it down (Jot it down)
Let me take a mental note (Mental note)
I put it all in this microphone (Microphone)
Think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song? I'm just ventin'
But what you expect from a therapy session, huh? [Chorus]
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session
[Verse 3]
What you think about me
—That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages, in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
""Christian"" is not the definition of what ""perfect"" means, woo!
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you, I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lyin'
People go off on my page, and I'm tryin' to quit the replyin'
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate, man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it a hundred?
Okay, I'll keep it a hundred
I see a whole lot of talkin' on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
""Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome""
""All of your music is moody and dark, Nate""
—Don't get me started (Yeah!)
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches, nah!
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
But what you expect from a therapy session?
Huh? [Outro]
I mean, I think sometimes people—they confuse what I'm doin'
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing
This is real for me
Like, this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and He gave me the ability to—to do this
And He also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something—or frustration
Like, this is where I go
This is—this is—that's the whole ""NF Real Music"" thing, man
This is real for me—I need this
This is a therapy for me"

Yeah, it's been a minute... this probably should have happened a while ago... fuck it we're here now though- let's go
Yeah, man... what the fuck? Yo, yo Snoop (oh man) let me see them buds, man... that shit's the size of my hand, Dogg- maybe I'll relapse, what the fuck...
[Verse 1: Eminem]
That's how I know that I'm in the studio with the Doggy
In Californ-E, 'cuz my homie from Long Beach
Always got that bomb weed, that's why I feel a calm breeze
Every time I palm trees (get it) just like that blonde bleach
I went platinum, then so did my albums, Calvin's turning me into a zombie
Cuz these buds are like The Hulk, they're twice the size that his arm be (his zombie)
And that is some strong green
Got a contact, my contact lenses are foggy, I might end up in Walgreen's
Pharmacy with my arm asleep gone off lean mixed with Dramamine
I will treat Paula Dean like a fuckin' human pinball machine
Bouncin' balls off her tonsils, if ya'll are seekin' the smoke I got all the weed
I am a walking motherfuckin' Marijuana leaf
And I'm here to stay
My reign's so definite (deaf in it) my longevity needs a hearing aid, still wearing Hanes
T-shirts I done bodied some features with legendary names
Was there when Dre turned the Chronic to monetary gain
'Cause dope is addictive just like they call it marijuana, cause like marriage, you wanna, marry Jane
It's like you and Spiderman feel the very same
My adversaries came
But these little degenerates are my lineage, when it comes to pockets weren't many if, any as skinny as mine bitch, I was penniless
Now I'm plenty rich, and the shit don't make any sense (cents) I was in a motherfucking pinch like a titty twist
Now I'm sitting as pretty as each penny is, while I'm penning this in the lab on you guinea pigs
I'm finna' fool, I'm in effect, gimmie the semi and when I pull the big guns out
That trigger pull it until the motherfuckin' shit runs out of bullets
Somebody better call an ambulance
You live, it will be miraculous, I got more hits than a contract killer
Like caterpillars that don't got antennas, other words I don't got no god damn fillers (feelers)
Mt. Westmore, you did not plan for this- from Detroit all the way to Los Angeles [Chorus: Eminem]
Put your doobies high, if you reside in 213
Let's see them blunts raised
Whether you Eastside or Westside of the 313
Let's see them guns blaze
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Make money moves like the matrix
Make more mount motivation
Roll up, more meditation
I'm watching the moves that you make might wanna stick to the basics
Military mindset, locked in, cocked in, making sure the mission is profitable
Ain't no mission impossib-ble
One phone call and my monsters will go
Dump phones, hop in a Mazda and go
Fuck that, y'all stay
Nigga I'm finna go
Think you slick, boy this Crip
You ain't ready to take it where I'm finna go
Mafia rules
You making a mockery, me a monopoly
Speak on my flow, my nigga I'm mopping 'em
Slept on my flo' now niggas is copying
Niggas be opping through all this opulence
Give me a task, I conquer it
This ain't the time for pondering
You niggas is slandering this real shit niggas be honoring
On god
You looking for followers and not watching my niggas that's following
Nigga fuck them likes
I'm like like what, like my nigga young Problem
East side, East up
My nigga Eminem woke the beast up
Let ya'll ride now a nigga want it back like the lease up
Think it's a game you gone see sum
Ain't no peace, you'll be missing a piece of ya
Niggas popped off, now sheets on 'em
Mama all mad, kids all sad, damn my bad
Send a few coins to the coroner
Please make a sweet for 'em
Nigga I don't hop on tracks I leap on 'em
In the fields with the cleats on 'em
Steve Job of the cannabis mob
In due time, nigga knew it be mine
Suge knew I'd go platinum the minute I signed
If you're looking for the facts, I'm the nigga to find
Young nigga sold crack in the middle of pine
To being the face of this cripping
Long Beach, these seas is different
4 man with the put on
Still getting bread with the niggas I put on
Yea, yea
I Put my hood on
Shit got cold I put my hood on
Yea, yea
Marshall and Calvin, both from the gutter like public housing
Now we both performing for 100's of thousands
Wearing no makeup, but we still be clowning muthafuckas! [Chorus: Eminem]
Put your doobies high, if you reside in 213
Let's see them blunts raised
Whether you Eastside or Westside of the 313
Let's see them guns blaze

Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin'
 
like ya involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life

Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
(In the room, and I run it)
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
[Interlude]
Ay on my momma, nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma, doe like...
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Soundwave, turn this shit up nigga
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free

Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
[Chorus]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
[Verse 2]
What you want, you a house, you a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""

Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow

Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
[Poem]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers"

Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right

4372,78585,Dear John,Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can"" [Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known
[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known [Outro]
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known"

Flipped the whole dub and gave it back, ""Boop, yeah""

Can I tell you a story
About a boy who broke his own heart?
And he always blamed everybody else
But the truth is that he did it to himself
Made a couple songs and they got big
And thought that he could do whatever he wanted
But it all left him with a hole in his heart
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Money buys you happiness
But, ooh-ooh-ooh
Doesn't buy you time
[Chorus]
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And I can't quit, goddamn it
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
Yeah, twenty-six and rich
How the hell did it come to this?
[Verse 2]
And I wish I could tell you
That everything is perfect, but it's not
I was staring at the ceiling for, like, ten days
But I'm pretty sure that I forgot
What it's like to be a person that doesn't think
That everything he does just sucks
Oh, it's a perfect world until it's not [Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Money buys you happiness
But, ooh-ooh-ooh
Doesn't buy you time
[Chorus]
The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
And I can't quit, goddamn it
And maybe I'm just broken
And I'll never admit it
But I wish that I was younger
Yeah, twenty-six and rich
How the hell did it come to this?

The more that I get older
The less I wanna be sober
Yeah, twenty-six and rich

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it overthinking, obviously
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
[Verse 1: Krept]
I saw a young G sitting on the wall
Had a gun in his bag on the way from school
I told him, ""If you get life you're a fool""
Then he said something that stuck with me
He said, ""I'd rather do life, than have none at all""
He said, ""Krept, you made it out fam, you're cool""
He said ""Me, I slip once, then I'm through
You'd do the same if you was in my shoes""
I said, ""Bro, I'm just tryna keep you alive
I'm sick of funerals, another suit and tie
How do you expect me to tell a young G
Put down the guns? That could be suicide
For him it's kill or be killed, fam it's do or die
He said, ""Krept, I don't even like this stuff
But I'm in too deep, I'm kinda fucked
I can't think straight when man are tryna line me up""
Just visited my boy today doing life for a crime where he didn't do shit
He said, ""Krept, what's good, how's the music?""
Didn't wanna gass it up too much
You know he's stuck doing life, he might lose it
Wishing he was out living life for the movement
When the MOBOs said we were the winners, he told the whole jail ""Brap, that's my niggas""
Happy but heartbroken at the same time cause he knows he would have been on the stage with us
Man this cold world could be so vicious
Put your hands together and pray with us
Need to see my family more
So busy that they probably think that I don't love 'em
Probably telling people I forgot about my cousins
He's gone to Hollywood now, man so fuck him
Man I'm stuck [Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it overthinking, obviously
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things is giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye
[Verse 2: Konan]
In New York I met my big sis for the first time, imagine that
I'm 24, it's the first time she sees me
Before he died, promised dad that she'd meet me
I know it ain't been easy, and I can't stay for the whole night
She hugged me with tears in her eyes
And said she wished that he still was alive
She said, your mum sent you Jamaica
She told me you came back ill
Yeah I know you ain't been back still
But you know your friend over there got killed
I know she always had love for me
Then she said something that stuck with me
""Dad said you gotta keep the music alive""
Then she gave the the look like it's up to me
It hit me hard, didn't show it though
Thinking 'bout it on the plane, going home
Growing up without my dad ever round
It's on me and I can't let him down
Before I stepped out the house
My niece said ""Make sure you come back again""
Then I started thinking 'bout the hearts that I broke
Praying that the karma don't come back on them
We spoke about everything
And how his wife's tryna take everything
All the inheritance
All because he gave her a wedding ring
So God forgive me for the minor things
Cause you'll risk everything when you're tryna win
And I can't go back, but the more I move forward
The more I start losing the sight of things
Dream chasing [Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Calling it overthinking, obviously
How can I do it if I try?
I should have known it from the last time
One can dream
Caught up in the same things is giving me life
One can dream
My mind will erase these memories, say goodbye
One can dream"

""Fuck you doin', you retard?""
Should be put in a cast as soon as we start shootin', dog
You swear I knew where the Roofies are
The way I drug a bitch... through the yard
Stuffed little Suzie in cardboard after wrappin' her nude and newly scarred
Body in waterproof tarp covered in roofin' tar
So what you so blunt for?
Did you fuckin' fall off, chump? Or did you jump?
Or did you just become bored with this?
You’re slipping into a funk, I just become morbid
And more self-absorbed in my own world, everyone orbits
Pen at the table, I don’t know when I’ll be able to stop
Told you from the gate
One thought it generally takes and I’m off to the races
Wait, mentally stable, hold your fuckin' horses
There’s nothin' more disgustin' an animal
I just got done snortin' the fuckin' bathroom soap
And the tannin' lotion
To unwarp this mind you gon' need some sort of an antidote
There’s not a pill for bananas though

Two joint forces, of course this is what blunt force is
'Cause we’d smoke you on any joint
Bad and Evil's back, bitch
You might experience some shortness of breath
As you sit with your lungs punctured

How to fuckin' hear from a ruptured eardrum
Forrest, am I clear? You Gump, you’re as dumb as a stump
To think we'd come with a trunk shortage

Devil without a cause, rebel without a pause
I am a kaze without the kami
You wouldn’t be a G if you cost me a thousand dollars
Infrared in my pencil lead
But always keep an extra one stocked though
In the back pocket and both of 'em locked
And they're loaded, like cocked twin Glocks that I’m holdin'
You better pause

Fuckin' punks, you wait,

I keep the chill one degree

You realize as soon as you beat me that you didn’t
Yeah, there’s still one of me, now me slap you
That’s a recap view, that’s normal embarrassing
And you slap me, that’s knee-slap humor, that’s hardly hilarious

I gotta problem I don’t like, it's called fuck a model-itis
Who pussy the tightest?
That’s amazing, sit your ass down
I don’t like the pussy too tight
Get the fuck outta here and have some babies

I’m so far ahead of the skills here
Getting ready for my past life
I’m the real deal

Like Holyfield, think you irreplaceable? Bite it

'Til I keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill and
Ebola in my bowl of oatmeal, you know the deal
I’m not about to sit and go through the whole spiel
Of how I’m- how I’m cold still like an old closed snowmobile
And no feeling but so jovial
But don’t be one of those who mistake me for a joke, I'm so for real
It’s what I told the phony emcee before I broke his will
Drove a drill through his skull to see his soul
Told him when I snap like a photo
He’ll get exposed like a roll of film
Now here he goes again, oh
I’m so trill, I’mma get the hoes again
Like Buffalo Bill's bitch, you didn’t put lotion in
The bucket, fuck it, beat the poor little old widow
With throw pillows, soap brillos,
 finished my goat milk then
Smoke billows I lit up— ah, fuck it!"

It's times like these, wish I had a time machine
So I could see what you did October 13th
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no ""us"" in us when I'm lackin' trust
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fuckin' fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you

I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration
, 
this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones

This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died

My manic depression make me constantly wanna panic
I'm stressing on stage, pretendin' everybody undressing
I think I'll never learn my lesson, but fuck it all, it doesn't matter
Ayo, I'm on a lyrical, poetic rhetoric
Lyrical miracle, satirical shit
If you don't like my conscious rap, you won't like my material shit
Love him or hate him, everybody know Logic can spit
Used to be up to date on that rap political shit
But nowadays I'm up to my elbows
And every single inch of my body in my baby's shit
I could tell you more about diapers than modern rappers in cyphers
I used to be about the B-Rabbits and Mekhi Phifers

Am I supposed to recreate it every album for you cunts? Okay
You want to hear about my everyday

And lead him into his car seat
Drive up the street down to Target
Don't do hard drugs or beat my wife
But the paparazzi still wanna start shit
I don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch
Then I walk through the automatic doors
A couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour
I ain't trying to ignore her
But I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck
And I need some new drawers
Then I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (
Can I have a picture?
)
Asking for a pic and I say sure
Scratch my dick and shake his hand
Shaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man
Now I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels
I also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels
A really hot girl walks by with a fat ass
But I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash
Forgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash
Then I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass
Head to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal
Is this want you wanted, everyday life material?
I'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring
Made it out the basement, now my bank account soaring
Most exciting part of my life is probably touring
Don't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city
But hotels suck and the internet is shitty
I mean, why rap about everyday shit
When I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this? [Chorus]

My Air Max 270s keep me grounded to this hypothetical floor. I’m hovering at the layer between what’s real and what I made up, which are the same being that much I know. And I should be lost on purpose, intention, made it across the universe like perfect, made you wish rehearsed it because it really does look so perfect. My imagination is a burden that has me lost and uncertain, but what nourishes me is Houston. What’s the difference between being lost and escaping? An attention. What’s the difference between a ladder and an elevator? Labor. Feel free to feel lost, it’s free, there’s no cost. The cacti fell over on the path, that’s how I noticed I can fly. The truth is, your always home. I create a city with no buildings or people, just deep breaths and daydreams, nightmares and ancestors’ energies fly and memory. I can get away, I can make it, whether it’s outdated and I’m Jaded, or I become the air and I made it. It maxed out our system like I twisted the mission and made the decision to be free or like other people who can’t see it, they call it, they say I’m lost now. When I laugh my breath mixes with clouds and causes a storm, because I’m not lost, I escaped. Keep your feet where you stand, everything else has escaped"

You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified

You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, ""Where's Ricardo?""
You said, ""Oh, no, not the show""
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, ""Oh, shit""
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
""My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy,
 
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"" [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home"

Guess who's bizzack?
You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do none wit it, straight from the oven wit it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time,
 drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall (Woo!)
Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off
That's why the streets embrace me, dog, I'm so cool! [Chorus: Kanye West]

Plainclothes wanna run in my room (Woooo)
But nigga, guess who's bizzack? It's your boy, Facemob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes [Bridge: Scarface]
It's a new game brewing, let me give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, ha
It's a new game goin', lemme give you the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, haha! (Whoa)

Guess who's bizzack? The boy, B-Mizzack (Yeah)
AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick (Straight)
Turn a whole one from a half a brick
Look, I mastered this, you can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make you swell up if you gasket-clipped
You can make your chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watching traffic switch
Young'un, never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz (Huh)
And keep your whole hood on flip (Ugh)
Like old box-spring, pissy mattress shit
No, won't box a thing, strictly blasting shit
I hug the block like quarter-water
 (Ugh)
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
'Til, like, deuce in the morning
With the old heads (Ugh), slangin' loose quarters (Quarters)
This Philly cat back at it (At it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts, still busting with that black-matic

They felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldn't come in her lifetime, just like I know it won't come in mine. It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more
[Verse 1: Punch]
I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him
Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him
Look a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him
Cause faces they change, but point of views remain
I got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different
Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living
My Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction
Was stress and I inherited his heart condition
And Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles
Petty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust
So I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust
I've only scratched the surface
, what's underneath this verse is
The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose
Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in
Police lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving
He ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
This is for my everyday young nigga
It don't really matter where you from niggas
Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga
Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga
Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel
What we gotta do just to live
Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled [Verse 2: Punch]
It's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars
Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars
I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws
Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls
Nickerson garden projects this is me y'all
Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall
Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw
The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all
They don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws
They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe
Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti
And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting
Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices
To the streets, this is the trinity
Money malice and murder the hood's deity
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
They say the average black man only lives to 25
Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive
Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death
That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps
Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose
That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man
My only fear is pops holding moms hand
Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen
By any means avoiding the city traffic
Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage
A young kid turned savage, city madness
A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness
I'm trying to live to see past this
Staring at the world and my rear view past tense
In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion [Hook]

""I’ll tell you what I don’t believe in, can I do that? All right, I don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in.""
""So what keeps you alive?""
""Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I’m a pretty dark person, I’ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.""
Thank you
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, 
I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me ""Rap about life, not rap niggas""
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to ""Faith,"" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, ""The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?""
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough) [Outro: Alori Joh]
We would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD. Because of you we are Overly Dedicated

The treetops are leaning, they're covered in snow
The fire is burning and you're nearly home
The bars are all empty, I can't hear a soul
With everything closed now, there's nowhere to go
[Verse 2]
Come rest your weary head on my chest
The year is behind us, we're still at our best
The magic of Christmas is what's coming next
So lean in and kiss me and all of the rest
[Chorus]
Baby, this time of year
Can makе you feel old
But when I am with you
I don't feel the cold
[Bridge]
So let's dancе in the kitchen and climb up the stairs
I hope when we wake up there's love everywhere, mm-hmm
Mm-mm
Mm
[Chorus]
Baby, this time of the year
Can make you feel old
But when I am with you
I don't feel the cold [Outro]
Hold on to your lovers, be good to your friends, mm
Remember the people who are no longer there
Lean into the moment, the memories you share
And have a Merry Christmas, everyone, everywhere"

Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine
[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin' [Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'
[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin' [Verse 3: J. Cole]
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'
[Chorus: J. Cole]
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah"

Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody 
(Nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!
[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Point it at your head, got the bread then you blacked out
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like you seein' a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't tryna stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing round-ups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now I'm stunned thinkin ""Fuck that"" (Fuck that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (Get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz [Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats, they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything,
 skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him, you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love, the hurt's pure
When you front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
You was right there back-to-back with me my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz 'em in then meet 'em right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead, you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'bout what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzers
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches [Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & 
Meek Mill

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (
Yeah, for life

There's a story in me
[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six Os in the bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up, I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm tryna get full, mask on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft and sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

Get 'em!
[Verse 1]
Living life on the East Coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunnid with you
It ain't about that; ain't about Hip Hop, ain't about Rap
Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap
Chicago, know I'ma snap
Nah, this ain't no basic rap
[Chorus 1]
And so they wonder who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
[Verse 2]
Back again, never outside so I'm acting in
I laugh again when they don't understand
What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man fuck that, do what's good for your family
Make music like there's no Grammy
For that last line, they might ban me
I don't give a fuck though
'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami
I'ma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I'm finna do
But I promise that I'ma keep writing for you
And I know what to do, everything right here for you
Only for you, depending on what you gon' do
It's all for you—it's all for you [Chorus 2]
Who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
[Verse 3]
Let me take this time to find the rhyme
And know that I'm the only one
To find the one, the time is done
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun
There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let 'em know
If you love it, let it go
At an all-time low and all I know is, all I know
I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that I'm into, everything that I've been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light
Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what I'm living like
In the middle of the night, I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (Wonder)
[Chorus 2]
Who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high [Sample: Alan Watts]
We'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets. We'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uh—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...
You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn't matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...
But, it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, is we're bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up ""their"" children, to do the same thing. So, it's all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question...
""What do I desire?""

He raps what he lives, so fuck the nanny, gon' sit

Belong on Rushmore just from chiselin' a brick
Still fightin' demons, see, that curse is now my gift
Secrets die with me, that's as deep as the abyss, that is no coincidence
When I was in the mix, opened up your nose like I'm cuttin' it with Vicks
Slavin' over stoves like I rub together sticks
Paved another road so my soul would coexist
But Heaven only knows, I won't dig another ditch
In a suit and tie, like you puttin' on the ritz
Three record deals show me ignorance was bliss
Tryna milk a game that is only two percent
X told you Hell is hot, I told you, ""Repent""
Faith never waivered as I walked along the fence
Faith moves mountains, so what are you up against?
Watch my brother 'round you bitches, I know he pretends
I greet you with the love of God, that don't make us friends
I might whisper in his ear, ""Bury all of them""

Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (
Young thing

Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces?
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated, I have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (
Ooh, yeah
)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (
Jaded

1239,1931,White America,Eminem,"[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)
[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought 
standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on [Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, 
look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (
Ooh, baby!
) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top,
 every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's— [Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, 
look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb
, 
it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for— [Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, 
look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! 
Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you"

Still...
Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up [Verse 2: Drake]
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish
 (ha)
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way

Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes

I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg

Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking **** bitch in her **** with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, or back out
Lookin' for somebody 'of' to beat the crap out

I'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends
Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' TECs at you until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you (Ah!)
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth (Grrr)
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half, suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'mma get the East and West beefing again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire [Verse 4: Missy Elliott, 
Missy as girl

Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy!
 Get back
Uh, I'mma put you all in the line uh, and I'mma watch you MC's die

Yeah, I'mma have to bus' you through your chest and

This feel like a rebirth, another day on this green Earth
I couldn't ask for much more man, shit could be worse
A fresh pair of jeans, a nice clean shirt
I'm on my island in the sun, shout out to Weezer
Who can you count on these days in 2017
Lil' nigga, big city, bigger dreams
I copped a house out in the hills just to switch scenes
And now they back home saying ""How could Vic leave?""
I got Chicago on my mind like I'm Ray Charles
Georgia, promise I'll be faithful
I know I missed some action, I've been AWOL
I can't smoke witchu everyday, I ain't Nate Dogg
I put you up in my crib when you lost your granny house
You never gotta thank me for that man, that's family talk
I stayed in the studio, I took the Grammys off
And put my soul in this shit like I'm Diana Ross
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I

I know that I don't call like I should, I hope that everything's good
And Mom's doing well at that school in Kenwood
And Lizzie's still happy up at Ballet Memphis
I know she would've been at Grandma's funeral if she could
I rarely share my problems with ya but I'm glad to have a father figure
I know I grew up more blessed than a lot of niggas
A lot of niggas' pops is like lottery tickets
They bet on them but never get to hear their number call up
Coming home soon as the summer's on
I took the winter off in L.A. cause the city's too cold
But I'm heating up, soon as I drop the album
We on an island like Friday in Robinson Crusoe
Hit the town with my old man, make him feel young again
I know he proud of that tattooed son of his
All them tears I put you through when I was a kid
Calls from the police station when I was hustling
You used to hate to hear the phone ring
Now you can't wait to hear the phone ring, ain't that a beautiful thing?
Thanksgiving pull up with my Beamer and my gold chain
I know I tootin' my own horn like Coltrane
But didn't I, didn't I tell you 'bout your baby boy?
I used to rock the wife beater like Baby Boy
And now I'm suit and tied up without a day in court
Picked the house out, I put up the down payment for it
I caught the first plane when I heard your mama died
I seen her through the window, she was flying in the sky
Looking down on you, proud of you
This is for my grandma, told you we would show out for you [Chorus: Vic Mensa &

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
[Chorus]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago [Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
[Chorus]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me [Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there

Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well [Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It's like takin' a picture and then somehow rewindin' it back
Sixteen years, homie, sixteen years
Fast forward, now I'm sellin' out arenas with Wiz
Arenas alone, so leave us alone
Nowadays, all I really need's a beat on my phone
Maybe a pen and a pad when I'm really deep in the zone
A lot of shit has happened since I first started rappin'
I got a deal, made a mill', thirty somethin'
I'm over the hill, it's gettin' real, but, I still
I do it 'cause I love it, always have, always will
That's a dead giveaway like my family's will
Murdered the beat like Amityville, damn it, he will
Keep it real, all the time, killin' a rhyme, let me shine
It's only a matter of time before I find the next thing
No such thing as resting, I'm the king, here to shine like bling
When it comes to Logic, you really never know what you're gonna get
I'm off to the next one, when I write a rhyme, I remember none of it
But I'm done now, gonna run a mile, then see my wife and my son a bit
What's up, yeah? [Chorus: Lauryn Hill &

I feel a separation coming on
'Cause I know you want to be moving on
I wish it would snow tonight
You'd pull me in, avoid a fight
'Cause I feel a separation coming on

'Cause the truth, I'd rather we just both deny
You kissed me with those open eyes
It says so much, it's no surprise to you
But I've got something left inside

And everybody else gon' see you for you
Good and bad, yin and yang, it's the same
It depends on your intentions, what's your aim? What's your end goal?
I had to touch down on myself, I'm in the end zone
A nigga had to go to hell twice just to get home
A nigga had to pay the whole price just for his skin tone

Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way

And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
And call it the exchange [Verse 2]
Blink twice if it's true
But do you think about it too (you, you do)
You said you're running out with her
It tells me that you do (I know that you do)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because [Chorus: Kanye West &

Yup
I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice [Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, 
and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down,
 I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma

You know them pigs no good like pork rinds

They pulled him over, if they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright
Yeah, right
‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white
AK on the backseat
Trunk full of cocaína
He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em,"" now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”
And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch
She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it
He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it
He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens
Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo

Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh
Four more shells went to his face like gazelles
Bloody, they laced him up well

Stop bullshittin', boy, you wild, stop playin' yourself

Police barricade the buildin', what?
Now we stuck
Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)
Eleven more shots

Chain popped off, caught him in his top
Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & 
Kanye West
]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine,
 feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
 seen through 
Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because— [Chorus: Shirley Bassey & 
Kanye West
]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands [Chorus: Shirley Bassey & 
Kanye West
]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (
Are you happy, Hov?
)
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays 
in hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter
 and a new beach chair
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave

(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave [Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day, hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Son said: ""Hov, how you get so fly?""
I said: ""From not being afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell, so when I say farewell
My soul will find a even higher plane to dwell
So fly, you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair
[Chorus: Chris Martin & 
Jay-Z

I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream

Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream [Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life, just eyes
So to map it out, you must look inside
Sure, books could guide you, but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, maricón
I am on permanent vacay, 
life is but a beach chair
This song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes; 
and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament: I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair
[Chorus: Chris Martin & 
Jay-Z
]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave

""Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?""
No, I didn't, but thanks, though
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else

Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

And on my page and on the whole world

Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown [Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing

I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news

In an alleyway, drinking champagne [Chorus]

Yes, we were somewhere else"

Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police, as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef, I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me
I ain't bust, but now I'm touchy, trust me
Ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buckshots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem
Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin', 'cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vests don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails

Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more

Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent

And I really tried taking you serious baby, it’s really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross?

We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone

Uh-huh
(Uh-huh)
Yo, alright, yo
[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, 
I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like 
twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into 
red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
""Come follow me into the gates of Hell""
I heard 'em yell ""Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!""
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by 
his mother
Covered in dry blood, 
head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a
 bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners"

These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (
Distracting
), reacting (
Reacting
)
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (
My own reflection
)
It's haunting (
It's haunting
) how I can't seem [Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & 
Mike Shinoda
]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)
 
Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)
 
Confusing what is real"

I got a place that only I can go
Let me take you to flight school

You've never been so high, kiss the ground goodbye
And you say, damn baby how did you get that fly?
Flight school

I got the airplane passes, the aviator glasses
She be lookin fly like aviator classes
So classy, Jacqueline Onassis
Used to sneak and move like Ali, Cassius
Massive, like Kennedy's assassin
We was killin' time like clocks in the casket
Perhaps its time to prevail
I'll show you Gotham City like I'm Christian Bale
I can be Barack and let you be Michelle
Miguel, Gizelle, dress fresh as hell
Louis, Gucci, Ye in that pastel
Adore Dior, ride down Lake Shore
She felt the vibe, I had to make sure
She felt deprived livin like she died
Slide with a G, now she felt revived
In town for the night, she's somebody wifey
The Air Yeez', she never seen these
So the moment I might seize
I done come up out the coma of livin life's dreams

These the last hours, but superman late
The clock is ticking, damn can you wait?
Man, will he come back and save the day?
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse
That'll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head, great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away, then we performed CPR
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimp'd My crib, so I must exhibit
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit [Hook: T-Pain &

Uh
What if I told you that I was different?
What if I told you that something's missin'?
And what if I told you we're not alike
And the way that I feel inside is different than what you picture
What if I told you I feel divided?
Keep to myself and I'm awfully quiet
And what if I told you I been conflicted by my own thoughts
Trapped in the dark, and I tried to hide it
No, I'm not a slave to no fuckin' fairy tale
I bet you think that you know me very well
Make no mistake, this is not a cry for help
'Cause I don't owe no one no explanation on how I feel
[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
But on the real, what if I told you that I was brave?
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?
[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah
What if I told you I'm not alright?
I mean, I don't feel dead, but I'm not alive
And what if I told you, ""I'm not like you""
And the shit I've been goin' through, it'll prolly make you cry
And what if I told you, ""I'm not this""
And the person you think you know don't exist
Look, I'm not who you know, I'm not who you wish
I'm not who you want me to be, what you want from me isn't this
I grew up in church where I couldn't be myself
I felt like a prisoner, couldn't leave my cell
They told me, ""God don't like ugly,"" and this an ugly world
And if I ever seen things different, then I would burn in hell
[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
And on the real, this is not new, this is not a phase
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?

Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh [Verse 3: Eminem]
What if I told you I'm homophobic?
And you have zero control over your impulses
And the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit
It's something I can't sugarcoat, it's repulsive
We were homies, since children, I thought it
But thought I was buggin', though
'Cause we'd sit, chill and just talk chicks
Now how can we be friends still after all this
Unless, I can convince you to repent
Ask God to forgive you for your sins
And begin healin' your conscience
And rid you of this sick illness that causes it
Part of me wishes you'd kept this shit, still in the closet
I'm white but I'm gettin' mixed feelings like Logic
Yeah, I'm pissed off a little, this is a choice
We were supposed to be boys
You're actin' like this ain't optional
What if I said you was weak?
'Cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you
That's responsible for them homosexual thoughts
If you don't want a lecture, part
Like a sofa section or long as you
Make your decision and stand by it, but I can't be beside it
'Cause for me, that'd be next to impossible
Or you learn to control your urges
You say, ""It's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons""
But how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin
Why can't you be a normal person?
What if I tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend?
Wouldn't work, would it? You seem pretty surefooted
I'm sure good at judgin', but I have no right
I know goodbye seems cold, right?
Not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light
As I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night
And no, I didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life
I ain't mean for that shit to happen, I said I won't cry
I let the best friend that I've ever known die
Alone, was gonna tell you the next day
I'm so sorry, I'm fightin' my own demons, I won't lie
They won't leave me alone, eating at my soul, this whole time
I've been tortured, imprisoned in my own mind
A born again Christian but Lord if you're listenin'
We might be headed for a collision
'Cause when I told my boy I couldn't support his decision
I was tryna make it seem like a choice, when it isn't
Can't be cured with a prayer to Saint Jude
What If I told you my wish never came true?
What if I'm a hypocrite who's afraid to just face truth? Wait
What if I told you I'm gay too? [Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh

Man, I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Man, I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I  just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See, I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game, don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it
It's written in the stars, man, the sky is the author

I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB, you can do the math for me, bitch
Jail time, a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off, get it mailed out, stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well, tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me, but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos? He ain't throwing up signs
Well, let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
That's real, my nigga, remember that
And it ain't about if they remember you, they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets, slime

I'ma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, 'specially when you wrote ninety-percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'Fore you come up missin', like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of literature that I'm spittin' be hittin'
You gonna swear to God this shit was written
But it wasn't,
 I'll kill a dozen rappers when I'm buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now, you boys are about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladimir Konstantinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off
[RAP BATTLE 2]
I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin', ""I'm about to whip his ass
‘Cause I'ma do some written shit, plus I get to go last.""
Well, guess what? Even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo' verse
I'm 'bout to slice you like a Ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take your fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start takin' your period out on me
'Cause I ain't done shit to you [RAP BATTLE 3]
You wanna represent on the microphone, but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'ma do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Rhyme of the month? You couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I rip him like a paper mache
I heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched, like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out, like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush
I don't give a fuck, ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin' back with pimp shit
I laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics
[RAP BATTLE 4]
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah—stop babblin'!
You so fuckin' wack I'ma walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the Rap Coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion
Don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style is just one big sike
Take a big hike, bitch, you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit, like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew
And I don't give a fuck, I slaughter boys
Especially wack-ass emcees that will wear a fake-ass corduroy [RAP BATTLE 5]
I'm 'bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck—this shit fits you perfect!
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with you
I'll let a razor slit you, 'til they have to staple-stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn! All your white jokes just backfired
‘Cause, bitch, you barkin' up the wrong tree
Now go tell all your boys that you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya
Bitch, you better recognize me, like I look familiar
Anything you say, I'ma kill ya
Grill ya, when I fuckin' drill ya
I'm Marsh, but you're the one that's mellow"

Give us a ballot of names, and expect us to vote

Cut-throat niggas easily
They tryin' to snatch me, cuz they know I'm what ya
Used to be
Cuz I'm a major fu-uh-factor to C-M-B
But I keep a chopper
That's damn near as big as me
Cuz I refuse to let any nigga still me
That'll be stripes for a nigga on the fuckin' streets
Reppin' off me sayin' they shot the B.G
I get some weed and just roll up
This world tore up, niggas on that dope, sick, fold up
My clique rich wrapped in diamonds and pearls
Ya gotta be strapped, bein' rich in this dirty world"
335,4829991,What Do I Know About Love?,Camilla Cabello,"What do I know about love?
Nothing
Where does the love go when it runs out? When does it leave? Why does it die?
Do you kill it in one violent blow?
Or is it a million unattended, unhealed little cuts and scratches?
What do I know about love?
Everything
It creeps into my chest, uninvited and untameable
I know love has no mercy on anyone, rich, poor, independent codependent, confident, insecure
It'll bring you to your knees - if you did it right
What I know for sure about love is that you never come out of it the same
The other person is a chemical and I am a chemical and we both will come out as different people than when we met
I know when you're in love, kissing is everything
Because words aren't the only way to tell someone how you feel
I know when you fall in love you feel like you're the first and only two people in the world
Every kiss, every touch, every caress is like something you feel nobody has ever felt before
And you think - has everybody that's fallen in love before just walked around this nonchalantly the whole time?
You're at a restaurant with your friends and you can feel it, this
secret under your tongue
Burning like fire
But sweet
And it creeps up to your cheeks and makes you smile
And suddenly you look down and you see your heart's veins reaching, reaching, clinging to someone else's heart
I've learned a lot about love in my 20s, but not enough to maintain any control in the face of its power
And for every new thing I learned, there was something else I couldn't understand
All I know is love changes you
If you're lucky, to something better
What I know for sure is falling in love with life itself makes an artist out of everyone
I thought I was making art before
Writing songs was me making art but...
Now I want my life to be the work of art
And my songwriting to be the camera that I take a picture of it with
It's what I'm living
That's the art
What do I know about love?
Maybe nothing
And that's why it's everything"

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39 assembled here, the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried
[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darling, we'll away but my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me [Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Cannot heal me like your hand

If you had a second chance in life, what would you do?
Would you put the pills down? Throw out the lean too?
Treat your baby mama right and make way for your kids?
Peace with your enemies, keep the water under the bridge?
I think about if my motorcycle crash was fatal
Broken bones, internal bleedin', stretched on the table
Goin' through surgery, two machines helping me breathe
Sorry mama, I wanna stay but I gotta leave
I see my funeral packed, I see some lyin'
Some cryin' and some givin' dap
I see false claimers, strangers and foes with they head in they laps
I see mo' division
I see some of them showin' up just to post a picture
Like they was my nigga, Instagram's a dead man's best friend
Everybody lookin' for likes but wasn't likin' you when
You needed somethin' to hold on dealin' with life stress
Glad them angels came in surgery, said I'm not done yet!

I buy you flowers talk to you for hours, give you truth
I listen to you when you're hurt
I shoulda went to church with you
But my credentials didn't work, I still should've worked with you
I should've left them lil' hoes alone and came home
But I blamed the moments on you, though I was in the wrong
You checked my phone and I checked you 'bout it
We never talked it over, instead we just sexted 'bout it
I said, ""I'm comin' over"", you turned up and flexed about it
I hit yo mama phone
She said, ""Y'all get it together"", she don't know what we on
My response was whatever, I'm ego trippin' however
I hate to see you gone, she gave me that dial tone
I should've gave you more trust, more love, no lies, more us
'Cause when my motorcycle crashed and everyone left
You was that angel at surgery sayin' I ain't done yet, real shit

Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’

Well still, you break me

You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now? [Verse 2]
And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
 so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again
[Chorus]
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now? [Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?

'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina

Yeah
Same song and dance
Damn, girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight (Yo)
[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah, girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, “Well, hello, Tonya
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, ""Exact opposites attract""
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on"" [Chorus]
Yeah, baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, ""Yeah, baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?""
Same song and dance
[Verse 2]
The first victim I had
, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
""Hello, Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt!""
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
""Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, 
murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done""
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord [Chorus]
Yeah, baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, ""Yeah, baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?""
Same song and dance
[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell like, ""Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you, 'cause I'm feeling you, Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do"" [Chorus]
Yeah, baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, ""Yeah, baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?""

Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance

Same song and dance

If we put it all together can we pay this rent?"" (No)

Places I never should've been
I caught some changes
Changes that made me who I am

And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like, is you comin' home? Is you out with her?

Drop them drawers, give me what I want

Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend [Verse 2]
I gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them

And I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays

Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
[Verse 2]
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But, I would rather say it now in case I never get the chance [Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet [Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness
[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that [Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise

Said I was okay, when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free

Ha, ride
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 
Eminem
]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you- [Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & 
Eminem
]
He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, ""Take ten paces,"" shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, 
they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a ""G Thang""
And a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'""
I said, ""It's Dre's day,"" and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide

Joey, don't do it, Joey done did it
Joey keep doing it until you're done with it
Bring them to the crackhouse, this the crackhouse
Walk them to the crackhouse, we in the crackhouse [Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Get em, Joey just get em
Get em, get on them
And if they piss you off you shit on them
And if they piss you off you shit on them

Hey Weez just stop right there
Shit I don't let em go, get the whole block clear
These niggas actors, they are not there
And thier time's tickin' like an Audemars
First nigga pop up and we gave him the piece
Next nigga pop up leave him under the sheets
C'mon papa, you talkin to ME
Ain't nobody else runnin' these streets COCKSUCKER!

Heeey, this is the crackhouse, welcome to the crackhouse
Man I'm talkin' more pies than a frat house

I hope you find it cuz he about to lose it
Joey don't do it, Joey done did it
Joey keep doin' it until you're done wit' it
Take em to the crackhouse
They don't want the crackhouse, they don't want the crackhouse
Kick em out the crackhouse"

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MCs, MCs)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96
[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm infinite [Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite
[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
Some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MCs are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently
Sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite [Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite
[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be
‘Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm infinite [Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Clean water was only served to the fairer skin

And it's rich nigga racism
That's that, ""Come in, please buy more""

All you blacks want all the same things""

It's a little bit twisted, but I miss when you and I had scary dreams
I don't really wanna talk about it!
Well, that's too bad now, Nate
Shut up!
Now, where were we?
Well, back in the day when
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement
Cryin' in your room like a baby
""I wish mom was here!""
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it every single record

Yeah, it's time for the third record
And you know I got the content
I don't wanna make you nervous
But it ain't like it used to be, we got a lotta people watchin'

 was beautiful, Nate, but I'm wonderin' what's comin' next
Yeah, get that stupid hat off of your head when I'm talkin' to you, you hear what I said?

Yeah, you wanna know what the funny thing is?
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger
But we've been together since you were a kid (Kid), yeah
Took us from a no-name
Told you everything was okay
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it
I am the heart of it, I made this whole thing
Yeah, I put us on the dope stage, you must have no brain
What's the point of having guns if you can't aim?
What's the point of havin' blood with no veins?
What's the point of havin' love with no pain?
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense
I know I'm intense and controlling, but you need to learn how to cope with it, that's just the way that it is
If you didn't want me to live in your house, you shouldn't have let me move in
It's comfortable here and I like it, I got my own room and everything, it don't get better than this
You say you wanna own your life, then wake up and take your own advice
You just mad 'cause you know I'm right
Yeah, I'm flattered you put me in 
Mansion
, but you shoulda told 'em right
Hold your hands on the coldest nights
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold the mic
I mean, what are you, outta your mind?
'Cause both of us will be, come on, let's go outside!
Is this what you wanted?
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then!
I mean, why are you doin' this?
I know that you're mad (That you're mad), but I'm not in the mood for this

Yeah, it's real music 'til the day we die, right?
Yeah, ain't that the slogan, Nathan?
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
I mean, so what? You know I never listen
Let me guess: we gon' dig a hole, kill the track and prolly put a beat in it
Rap about it for like three minutes
Ayy, that's pretty deep, isn't it?
Wait a minute, you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?
No, of course not, just a little deeper then we'll go inside and we can stop diggin'
 (Woo)
You had me scared for a second, I thought we were diggin' my grave

We did, what, you don't like bein' afraid?
Here's a dose of your own medicine
What, you don't like how it tastes?
My therapist told me don't bury my issues, but I'ma be honest, man, I'm feelin' great! (Great)
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created
I wrote a song for Johnny without you, but he ain't gon' like it, let's see how he takes it (Takes it)
He probably don't even remember us, does he?
I wish I was buryin' anger
But both of us know I'ma need him for that song (That song), he still lives in the basement
Almost done, shoulda done this a year ago, I don't know why I waited
You know how I get, I put everything off in my personal life, you hear what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
That was a joke (Joke), yeah, it's hilarious, ain't it?
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind—depends how you see it
Put the shovel away, time to go back in the house now, you'll be out in a week
Tellin' me you want your room back, that's funny; what? You ain't got nowhere to sleep?
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you, this is crazy to me

Sé que el tiempo a tu lado cortó mis alas (Ah-ah)
Pero ahora este pecho es antibalas [Outro: (Selena Gomez y Jay Godí)]
Ya no duele como antes, no
La herida de tu amor sanó"

Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
I guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again
[Chorus: All, 
Zayn
]
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life (
My life
) would suck (
Would suck
) without you
[Verse 2: Liam,

Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for (
Trying to pick a fight

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly

I think that's what life is about
Truly findin' yourself
And then closin' your eyes and dyin' in your sleep
[Verse 1: Kid Cudi & 
Drake
]
Lifted are my days, my dreams are vivid colors (Woo)
The jet is low, they make me take your trips, we fly by (Let's go)
No stress is on my brain, no worries here, I'm chosen (Yeah, yeah)
Made another way, my nigga, watch me go shine
When I close my eyes my world comes alive (Yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la
People grow, good times sometimes (Nigga)
Real niggas in life survive (Yeah)
And I'm sailing to the edge of my mind
Nigga, double up life (Yeah, yeah)
Set the tempo, got a nympho on my line (Yeah-yeah)
Said she wanna unwind (She do)
And I'm focused on gettin' more
They too stuck on gettin' even, I'm ready for it
We should really be together more
'Cause I know we got some time but I'm never sure
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie
She checkin' for me, now baby come in my dreams, my dreams (Yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah [Post-Chorus: Drake & 
Kid Cudi

Finding myself as the days
Fly by like us on the move
You told me I was a phase
Okay, fine, I miss you too
Probably wouldn't believe me if I told you
Pieces of myself that I should never lose
All these people that love you don't know you
How am I supposed to move?
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
How am I supposed to move?
[Verse 2: Drake]
All my niggas rally 'round me
Bold niggas gettin' real italics 'round me
Finally circled, found the purple
Undisclosed amounts straight from Universal
Too commercial, 'leven years later I done found my purpose
Here I am, oh, they mad
Goin' out swingin' for 'em, goin' out sad
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Catch me ten-toes in the limelight (Yeah)
Fuck the world up, on my life, right (Nigga)
Sayin' I'm the one, she lie, lie
She checkin' for me, now baby come in my dreams, my dreams (Yeah)
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Hey-ayy, hey-ayy, hey-yeah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah [Post-Chorus: Drake]
Finding myself as the days
Fly by like us on the move

Okay, fine, I miss you too
Probably wouldn't believe me if I told you
Pieces of myself that I should never lose

Gettin' more
We should really be together more
But I'm never sure"
