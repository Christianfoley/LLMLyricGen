When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me ""baby""
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more [Verse 2]
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

Now I call you ""baby""

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels

(Once, I had an empire)","Swift wrote “Castles Crumbling” around 2010 for her third studio album, Speak Now. Since then, fans gained knowledge of the song, but no part of it was actually ever heard until it was released as a From The Vault track on Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) on July 7th, 2023, featuring Taylor’s long-time friend, Hayley Williams.
In June 2023, a fan gifted Hayley with a bracelet themed after Speak Now, fact to which she said that was “coming at a very interesting time.” Her reaction brought fans to speculate about her appearence on the album, which was later confirmed when Swift posted its tracklist. While announcing it, Taylor mentioned that Hayley’s band, Paramore, was a huge influence to her around the time that she wrote Speak Now.
Although “Castles Crumbling” marks their first collaboration, Hayley had already been a guest star during Swift’s 2011 Speak Now Tour, and had also made an appearence in the music video for her 2015 single, “Bad Blood.” Hayley is also heavily rumoured to have been the inspiration behind the song “Speak Now.”
Lastly, two days before the song came out, Swift revealed on Twitter that Paramore would be an opening act for several of Taylor’s The Eras Tour dates in 2024.",Castles Crumbling (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],Taylor Swift

As the name implies, many of the sexual references throughout the song pertain to dresses and the main hook of the song is something Swift herself admitted feeling really proud of. Taylor has a history of fascination with dresses dating back to her country music roots from when she first stepped foot in the music industry.
This song is most likely about Swift’s boyfriend at the time it was written, the british actor Joe Alwyn, who is also rumored to be Taylor’s muse for many other songs, especially throughout her 2017 and 2019 albums, reputation and Lover, respectively. The couple dated from 2016 until 2023 and “Dress” seems to be detailing Swift’s point of view from the beginning of their relationship — the bridge, specially, is full with references to when and how they first met.",Dress,Taylor Swift

As noted by a fan who catalogues Swift’s unreleased tracks, the song appeared on databases around June 2009, so she probably wrote it in 2008 or early 2009.

However, due to requests from fans, Taylor announced on May 24, 2023 that the track would be included on Midnights (Til Dawn Edition) which released on May 26, 2023 on streaming platforms.
This track describes Taylor in a state of heartbreak that she has previously not experienced. It “hits different”, that is, it is out of the ordinary.
While Taylor has previously shunned lovers who left her such as in “White Horse” and “Picture to Burn”, here, Taylor describes a situation of struggling to move on and wanting an ex back, similar to “Death by a Thousand Cuts”.",Hits Different,Taylor Swift

Inspired by a line from a Mad Men episode, Swift wrote this song to convey the desire to focus on the passion of love rather than being swayed by the negative or unwanted remarks of others.
On an October 2022 Instagram post Swift compares her 6-year relationship at the time with british actor Joe Alwyn to the themes of the song, stating:
I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just ‘public figures’, because we live in the era of social media. If the world finds out that you’re in love with somebody, they’re going to weigh in on it. Like my relationship, for six years we’ve had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff, and we just ignore it.

While “Red” describes a love that was “burning red,” this track is a more grown-up version of a love story. It shows that shades of red were a constant in the relationship, but maroon is a brownish crimson color; it is not a straightforward red but allows for complexities and honesty.",Maroon,Taylor Swift

The song also reflects on a relationship where the two were opposites of each other, in which this case is “Sunshine” and “Midnight rain”. Each wants something different out of the relationship and has different expectations.",Midnight Rain,Taylor Swift

The music is unlike any other Taylor song with the chords played in a unique way starting and stopping (sometimes with vocal effects added over). Taylor gives fascinating insight into her thoughts on want, desire, passion, lust, danger, and fear. What Taylor needs most is to be with the man she loves. It’s essential, like breathing for her. The music is stripped down during the bridge. A really good song that would have fit well on the album and perhaps been a fan favorite.
The song appeared online in its entirety on March 1st, 2023",Need,Taylor Swift

I remember
[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question [Verse 2]
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight [Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)

Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question","Reflecting upon a past relationship on “Question…?,” Swift asks her former lover if their newer romantic experiences compare to the time that they spent together. Implicitly, she hopes that their ex is similarly unable to move on from her and that their newer attempts at love are only “second best after that meteor strike.”
The track opens with an interpolation from “Out of the Woods,” off of Swift’s 1989 album. Like “Question…?,” “Out of the Woods” is a song looking back on the memories of a now-dead relationship.",Question...?,Taylor Swift

The second vault track from Taylor Swift’s re-released version of 1989, it delves into the complexities of a relationship, where the protagonist feels vulnerable and uncertain. Painting a picture of emotional turmoil, including feelings of sadness, anxiety, and longing, the song encapsulates the desire for the other person to stay, juxtaposed with the pain of feeling led on, ignored and left behind.
The song was released on October 27, 2023, along with the rest of 1989 (Taylor’s Version).",Say Don’t Go (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],Taylor Swift

Ahead of its release, Swift explained the meaning behind “Snow On the Beach” on Instagram, and also expressed feeling “grateful for life” to get to collaborate for the first time with Del Rey, whom she called “one of the best musical artists ever” and admitted being a “massive fan” of hers, although not the first the time, since Taylor had already voiced her admiration for Lana’s work in the past.
“Snow on the Beach” was the final Midnights track to be announced on Midnights Mayhem with Me. Swift revealed the title of the song, and Lana Del Rey being featured on it, during the final episode of her TikTok series.
Rumors of the duo’s highly-anticipated collaboration first sparked in April 2022, after Lana Del Rey shared a picture of her next to Swift and producer Jack Antonoff, a mutual collaborator of both singers, presumed to be the link between them working together.
Upon “Snow On the Beach”’s release, Swift received criticism from fans and the media for continuing to relegate female artists featured in her songs, and not meeting the expectations of a duet with Del Rey, one of the biggest female artists of 2022.
As a consequence, a new version of the song was released on Taylor’s Til Dawn album reedition issued in May 2023, with one of the verses sung by Lana instead.",Snow On The Beach,Taylor Swift

Like snow, like snow, uh-huh, yeah","Answering to many fans and their wish for Lana Del Rey to take on a more prominent role in “Snow on the Beach,” Taylor Swift got back together in the studio with her co-star to re-record a new version of the Midnights track.
Upon its original release, “Snow on the Beach” received a mixed response among fans and critics due to the fact that Taylor didn’t give Del Rey her own verse and relegated her to only sing background vocals, which made her join a list of previous Swift collaborators (The Chicks, HAIM) that suffered the same fate.
On February 7, 2023, Lana shared on Instagram that before recording their collaboration, she had no prior knowledge of becoming the only featured artist on Midnights, and stated that she “would’ve sung the entire second verse if [she] had known.”
Announced on May 24, this “More Lana Del Rey” version of “Snow on the Beach” is included on the Til Dawn edition of Swift’s tenth studio album, issued seven months after Midnights‘ release, along with a remix of “Karma” and the arrival of “Hits Different” to streaming platforms.",Snow On The Beach (feat.

Taylor originally teased the track via a video she  posted to her Instagram account on September 19, 2023. The video features a vault with the letters and symbols of the track title coming out of it. Taylor would reveal the full tracklist on September 20, 2023, and the song released with the rest of 1989 TV on October 27, 2023.",“Slut!” (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],Taylor Swift

The chorus resonates with a sense of destiny, acknowledging that some bonds are destined for greatness, even amidst heartache, and reaffirms the profound impact of this connection on the protagonist’s life.
The song’s outro portrays the passage of time and the emotional turmoil that accompanies it. Swift skillfully employs imagery of a ticking clock, crashing waves, and the absence of a familiar knock to convey a sense of loss and longing.

The themes of this song heavily parallels Swift 2020’s track “no body, no crime”, which also sees her involved in vigilantism.
Musically, this song continues with heavy synths reverberating, never quite building to its climax. The sultry, building tune creates a dreamy atmosphere similar to that of “Dress” or “Call It What You Want”, but the subject matter is considerably darker.",Vigilante Shit,Taylor Swift
