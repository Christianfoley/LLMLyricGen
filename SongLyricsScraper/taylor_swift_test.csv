Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open
[Verse 1]
The tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't
Yeah, you got something they don't [Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta keep your eyes open
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes—
[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open","“Eyes Open” is one of two songs Taylor wrote for the soundtrack of the first Hunger Games movie, but it is not included in the film. The song appears to be about Katniss’s relationship with the Capitol, and serves as a warning for her not to trust anyone.
Taylor teased the song at a concert in Auckland prior to its release, performing it on an acoustic guitar to give fans a feel for the track. It debuted on Billboard Top 100 at number 19 and was received with general critical acclaim from contemporary critics.

Swift teased lyrics from a song in a since-deleted Instagram post from October 2014. She released it as the album’s third single in February 2015, following “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space,” along with a music video starring Dominic Sherwood.
As of December 2015, RIAA has certified the song triple platinum, with over three million units sold in the United States, and it’s also been certified triple platinum in Canada. It’s also double platinum in Australia, gold in New Zealand, and gold in the United Kingdom.
Swift’s friend Lorde shared via Twitter that this is her favorite song on 1989.",Style

Twenty stitches in the hospital room

It was the second promo single released from 1989, and later became the sixth official single. It was co-written by Jack Antonoff of Fun. and Bleachers, who worked on many songs for the album, and later joined Taylor to create her 2017 album reputation. It is known that she was writing to track for this song, something she was not used to at the time.
A short preview of the song was shown on Good Morning America on October 13th, 2014, and the full version was released the next day. The song’s music video was premiered on December 31st, 2015, during ABC’s annual Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin' Eve broadcast.
The song’s hidden message is, “They loved each other recklessly.”
The blue dress that Taylor Swift wore in the music video made a return at the beginning of the 2017 “Look What You Made Me Do” music video:

There wasn't much love to lose

How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?

Bet I could still melt your world

However, due to requests from fans, Taylor announced on May 24, 2023 that the track would be included on Midnights (Til Dawn Edition) which released on May 26, 2023 on streaming platforms.
This track describes Taylor in a state of heartbreak that she has previously not experienced. It “hits different”, that is, it is out of the ordinary.
While Taylor has previously shunned lovers who left her such as in “White Horse” and “Picture to Burn”, here, Taylor describes a situation of struggling to move on and wanting an ex back, similar to “Death by a Thousand Cuts”.",Hits Different

Better man","A cut from Taylor Swift’s 2012 Red album, “Better Man” captures the feeling of getting out of a toxic, perhaps abusive, relationship and accepting the sorrow that follows the breakup.
“Better Man” was Swift’s first country track in over two years — she crossed over to pop with her 2014 record 1989. She later gave another Red reject, “Babe,” to Sugarland, and recorded her own renditions of both songs on her 2021 Red (Taylor’s Version) project.
The song won a Grammy for “Best Country Duo/Group Performance” at the 2018 Grammy Awards.",Better Man

“Renegade” is one of two Taylor Swift collaborations on How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last?, along with “Birch,” both of which she helped co-write. As reported by Secretly Store, Swift recorded her vocals while quarantining with Aaron Dessner ahead of the 2021 Grammys, where Swift and Dessner won the Album of the Year accolade for folklore.

The song follows Taylor’s simple gratitude and love of the life that she has built with boyfriend Joe Alwyn. Swift speaks of how she finds peace in her romantic relationship with her partner who asks “sweet nothing” of her as opposed to the pressures she faces from the media, a topic Swift has written about frequently, namely in her 2017 album reputation and the Midnights lead single “Anti-Hero”.
The song is written by Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn under the alias, William Bowery. This is not the first time that Alwyn/Bowery has been featured as a writer on one of Swift’s tracks. Bowery has writing credits on folklore’s track 4, “exile”, and track 14 “betty”, and evermore’s “champagne problems”, “coney island”, and the titular closing track “evermore”.",Sweet Nothing
