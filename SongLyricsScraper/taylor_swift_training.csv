The title of this song was teased in Swift’s  music video for her single “Lover”. In the video, a hand plays the words “After” and “Glow,” on a scrabble board.

Notably, the board is titled “King of Hearts,” a nod to “King of My Heart,” which is a song on Swift’s album reputation, hinting that the two songs are about the same person, namely her steady boyfriend of over three years, actor Joe Alwyn.",Afterglow

She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.
Swift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.
Many believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal — the secret message “Maple Lattes” is hidden in the song’s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.
“All Too Well” was the fourth song to contribute to Swift’s “Track Five pattern,” a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were “Cold As You,” “White Horse,” and “Dear John.”",All Too Well

It’s part of Swift’s famous “track five” pattern — through the years, her fans have pointed out her tendency to make the most emotional song on the album the fifth track.
A big theme in Swift’s romantic songs is the prospect of a lover staying with her — see 2012’s “Stay Stay Stay,” 2017’s “New Year’s Day,” and 2019’s “The Archer,” another track five.
Swift gave fans a preview into the lyrics on October 18th, 2014, when she posted this picture on her Instagram:

Largely serving as a parallel to 2019’s “The Archer”, the song shows a darker self-perception from Swift than usual, and goes into detail about what she feels are her personal failures.
The track’s title and track number were revealed in the sixth video of her TikTok game Midnight Mayhem With Me on October 2nd, 2022. The next day, Swift released a ‘Behind The Song’ video to discuss the meaning and purpose behind the track, saying she “struggle[s] a lot with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized"", and described the song as a “guided tour"" of the things she hates about herself.
On Halloween night of 2022, the song was announced to have debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Marking her ninth number one single and fifth number one debut, “Anti-Hero” joined nine other songs from Midnights in constructing the entire top 10 – the first time ever in Billboard history.",Anti-Hero

The song describes an ill-fated summer romance, similarly to Swift’s earlier works like 2006’s “Tim McGraw.” Fans believe it’s the second part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of the girl James cheated on Betty with. The storyline is preceded by “cardigan” and followed by “betty.”
In the folklore album prologue, Swift says the album is inspired by “the sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.” It’s also worth noting that August is the eighth month of the year, and “august” is the eighth track on folklore—and folklore is Swift’s eighth album that has eight deluxe versions.",​august

The track, which fans believe is about actor Jake Gyllenhaal, finds Taylor looking back on a failed relationship. She gave the song to Sugarland in 2018 before recording her own rendition for Red (Taylor’s Version).

Your guard is up and I know why

Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

When fear crept into my mind

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

The song was Swift’s first to feature orchestral arrangements, the second being fellow Speak Now track- ‘Haunted’.  The song was successful, receiving critical acclaim and peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It went on to win two BMI Awards- ‘Publisher of the Year’ & ‘Award Winning Songs’, as well as a Teen Choice Award for ‘Choice Break-Up Song’.

For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?’ Then last year, the other star crossed a line.
She did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.

Much speculation has been made about who this song is about, with one popular theory suggesting Katy Perry. Perry seemed to think so herself, tweeting the day after the Rolling Stone feature was published:

Swift leaves the sort of loss open to interpretation, but it likely signifies a miscarriage or the loss of a loved one that was gone too soon. Additionally, parallels to “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve”, the nineteenth track of Midnights (3am Edition), imply it could be about Swift ‘losing’ her childhood and innocence after allegedly being groomed by a 32-year-old John Mayer when she was 19.",Bigger Than The Whole Sky

Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?

To every single time that they play this song

When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey

The song takes a more feminist approach, portraying the narrator as a person named James who can’t own up to their mistakes, all while Betty flourishes on her own and recognizes her worth.
Sonically, the song exudes a strong sense of nostalgia, delivering production and instrumentals reminiscent to Taylor’s earlier projects like Fearless and Speak Now, both of which were records written by Taylor in her similarly naïve adolescence.
“betty” is believed to be the third part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of James. The storyline is preceded by “cardigan” and “august.”
Interestingly, James' gender is never explicitly stated—James and Inez (mentioned in the pre-chorus) are, in fact, the names of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds‘ eldest daughters—leading some to believe that James could be a girl and that the Teenage Love Triangle is, in fact, a sapphic love story.
However, Taylor confirmed James' gender while explaining the song on country radio:
[James] has lost the love of his life basically and doesn’t understand how to get it back…Everybody makes mistakes, everybody really messes up sometimes and this is a song that I wrote from the perspective of a 17-year-old boy. I’ve always loved that in music you can kinda slip into different identities and you can sing from other people’s perspectives. So that’s what I did on this one–and I named all the characters in this story after my friends' kids.""",​betty

A picture of Taylor’s early concept tracklist for Fearless shows that the original title for this song was “The One Thing”. Multiple lyrics were changed from the demo to final production. It was likely taken off of the original tracklist because of its similarities to Michelle Branch’s Goodbye To You.

After the song was announced, many fans were quick to point out lyric parallels between the bridge of this track and her 2008 hit “Love Story,” on which Taylor daydreams about running away with her boyfriend.
In 2019, Taylor reflected on songs like “Call It What You Want” from her album ‘reputation’ as the ones that told the true love story of her relationship.
In her September 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, she tells us that it’s about her “newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on [her] own terms for the first time.”",Call It What You Want

Champagne problems","“champagne problems” tells the story of a woman who shocks her would-be fiancé and their loved ones by turning down a marriage proposal right before Christmas. In an essay about evermore, Swift stated that the song depicts “longtime college sweethearts [who] had very different plans for the same night, one to end it and one who brought a ring.”
The song implies that the protagonist has a history of mental illness, which the town subsequently stigmatizes in their gossip surrounding the failed proposal. Mental health is a topic especially personal to Swift, who has been transparent publicly about her own struggles. As quoted in an interview with the Zach Sang show:
I definitely don’t feel good all the time, and I don’t think anybody does…there have been times where I needed to take years off because I just felt exhausted, or I felt, like, really low or really bad.",​champagne problems

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you

And I'll do anything to see it through

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered

But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives

Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up

Hallelujah","The thirteenth track of Swift’s sophomore album is about her path into the spotlight. At age sixteen, she was signed to the emerging Big Machine Records, which was the smallest record label in Nashville.  There were only about a dozen employees, and she was the only artist. Despite the unpromising situation, she trusted that the label would eventually rise.
After writing the beginning of it, she let the track rest for a while, waiting for a significant moment in her life that could conclude it. That moment came in 2007 when she won the Horizon Award at the CMAs. After looking out into the audience and seeing her manager Scott Borchetta, crying, she felt like she could finally finish the song, and did so the following day.
That’s when I finished it, because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me.",Change

Tay wonders what would become of Christmas Day if there were no material things like gifts — would people still celebrate the birth of the Savior Jesus Christ, or would it just be some random day in December? She concludes that the true meaning of Christmas is the recognition and celebration of the man who sacrificed himself to save us all from our sins.",Christmas Must Be Something More

Think I'm finally clean","In an interview with Elle magazine, Taylor said the following about “Clean”:
“Clean” I wrote as I was walking out of Liberty in London. Someone I used to date— it hit me that I’d been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn’t thought about it. When it did hit me, it was like, ‘Oh, I hope he’s doing well’. And nothing else. And you know how it is when you’re going through heartbreak. A heartbroken person is unlike any other person. Their time moves at a completely different pace than ours. It’s this mental, physical, emotional ache and feeling so conflicted. Nothing distracts you from it. Then time passes, and the more you live your life and create new habits, you get used to not having a text message every morning saying, ‘Hello, beautiful. Good morning.’ You get used to not calling someone at night to tell them how your day was. You replace these old habits with new habits, like texting your friends in a group chat all day and planning fun dinner parties and going out on adventures with your girlfriends, and then all of a sudden one day you’re in London and you realize you’ve been in the same place as your ex for two weeks and you’re fine. And you hope he’s fine. The first thought that came to my mind was – I’m finally clean.
“Clean” has a different meaning to fans who’ve had struggles with mental illness, addiction, and abuse – it’s about being quite literally clean. While Taylor didn’t think of that meaning originally, she immediately accepted the fandom-wide meaning once she heard of it.
Taylor gave several inspirational speeches before performing “Clean” during her 1989 World Tour. Taylor said the following before performing “Clean” in Tokyo on May 5th:



The hidden message to Clean is “She lost him, but she found herself, and somehow that was everything.” This song is not just about losing someone you love – it’s also about losing yourself. Being clean is about moving on as a person and really taking care of yourself mentally.",Clean

Ooh-oh","“Cold as You” is the fifth track of Swift’s debut album and details her experience with an emotionally unavailable guy. Unlike Shakespeare who compares his lover to a summer’s day Swift compares her lover to a cold, rainy day. She told Rolling Stone that this is her favorite song on the album. In the interview, she said:
The hook is ‘I’ve never been anywhere cold as you.’ I love a line in a song where afterward you’re just like ‘burn.’
Swift penned this song with her frequent collaborator Liz Rose. She explained it in publicity materials:
I wrote this song with Liz, and I think the lyrics to this song are some of the best we’ve ever written. It’s about that moment where you realize someone isn’t at all who you thought they were, and that you’ve been trying to make excuses for someone who doesn’t deserve them. And that some people are just never going to love you. We were halfway through writing this when I started singing ‘And now that I’m sitting here thinking it through, I’ve never been anywhere cold as you’.
Notably, “Cold As You” is responsible for beginning Taylor’s track record of the 5th song of each of her albums being “emotional vulnerable” ballads.",Cold as You

In her Apple Music Awards 2020 interview, Taylor notes that closure is one of the overarching themes in the album: “Evermore deals a lot in endings of all sorts, shapes, and sizes, all the kinds of ways we can end a relationship, a friendship, something toxic, and the pain that goes along with that.”
The track is supposedly about Taylor’s former friendship with model Karlie Kloss. Lyrics like “staying friends” and “new life” suggest that they are no longer friends, especially as Taylor and Karlie have no longer been seen together. As she recently married, Karlie’s “new life” has spent large amounts of time with her extended Kushner family, Scooter Braun, and new friends.",​closure

The two met officially at the Met Gala in May 2016, although she was dating DJ Calvin Harris at the time and started seeing Tom Hiddleston shortly after. The fling between the two likely began soon after, lining up with the summer of 2016. Moreover, Taylor seems to suggest that she secretly fell in love with Joe, who she describes as a “bad boy,” during what was supposed to be a physical relationship.
Swift’s release of Lover comes accompanied with a personal journal, where she describes the summer of 2016 as “the apocalypse,” summarizing how painful it was for her.
Taylor’s vulnerability and the theme of this song is similar to the November 2017 track “Delicate.”",Cruel Summer

Making you my centerfold","“coney island” marks Swift’s first collaboration with The National after working heavily with band member Aaron Dessner on both the writing and production of evermore and folklore.
Like much of The National’s extensive catalogue, the track is subdued and melancholic sonically. Through the use of back-and-forth conversational lyrics littered with imagery that is rich with bygone experiences, it evokes a heavy feeling of loss and nostalgia for a past relationship where effort was not equal from both sides.
The lyrics contrast with the title location itself–Coney Island–a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York that is famous as a tourist destination for its lively carnival park setting. Additionally, the community district is Brooklyn 13, a number that is particularly special to Swift.",​coney island

Besides the obvious song title, there are multiple references to Mayer directly, including the mention of their over ten-year age gap. Sonically, Taylor purposefully added guitar slurring to the background instrumentals, a guitar playing technique seen all throughout Mayer’s music.
The two notably collaborated on Mayer’s 2010 song “Half of My Heart,” which was released 4 months before “Dear John”.
Besides John’s public statement to Rolling Stone in 2012, Mayer also replied to “Dear John” three years later, in his 2013 song “Paper Doll.” In the song, John directly replies to Taylor’s line, “you paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain” with, “and if those angel wings don’t fly, someone’s going to paint you another sky.”
Notably, “Dear John” was the third song to contribute to Taylor’s streak of having “emotional vulnerable” ballads as the 5th track of an album.",Dear John

The song is written from the perspective of an advice columnist, and in it, Taylor attempts to give the listener (or reader) life advice. She advises the listener to, among other things, be wary, reinvent themselves, bend when they can but not bend over for others who ask of them, and keep secrets. These are all meant not to be trusted, as the narrator themself warns the listener not to. In the song “Dear Reader”, the narrator has come into a very isolated, desperate life, which provides a fitting finale to an album touching on self-doubt, mistrust, and pain throughout.",Dear Reader

Swift referred to the titular character as a “girl who left her small town to chase down Hollywood dreams.” “tis the damn season” is likely the story of her return back home for the holidays.
“dorothea” itself seems to be told from the point of view of an old hometown lover.
Taylor has clarified the Dorothea narrative is “not a direct continuation of the betty/james/august storyline, but in [her] mind Dorothea went to the same school as Betty, James, and Inez.”",​dorothea

Swift announced that “Electric Touch” would serve as the first vault track on her re-recorded edition of Speak Now. She further revealed that Fall Out Boy with whom she had performed at the 2013 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, would be featured on the song. Notably, Patrick Stump–the lead singer of Fall Out Boy–had also made a special guest appearance during Taylor Swift’s Red Tour.
The decision to feature Fall Out Boy on the track was explained by Swift in a post announcing the album’s rerecording:
Since Speak Now was all about my songwriting, I decided to go to the artists who I feel influenced me most powerfully as a lyricist at that time and ask them to sing on the album.
Swift has often mentioned the influence Fall Out Boy have had on her songwriting over the years, revealing to Zane Lowe that Pete Wentz and previous collaborator Lana Del Rey are her favorite lyricists and telling Rolling Stone in 2019:
I love Fall Out Boy so much. Their songwriting really influenced me, lyrically, maybe more than anyone else. They take a phrase and they twist it. “Loaded God complex/Cock it and pull it”? When I heard that, I was like, “I’m dreaming.”",Electric Touch (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault]

It describes Swift running into her ex, and the encounter causing her to remember their past together and feel the pain of their history together that hurt her. She doesn’t understand how this person doesn’t feel the same pain that she does, but resigns herself to moving on with her life, and rejecting the person’s desire to pretend to stay friends.

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy

Taylor, I was so in love with you","This song is a cover of Taylor Swift’s “Enchanted”, posted to Adam Young’s blog on Valentine’s Day 2011. This version retains most of the lyrics, with some minor changes to reflect Adam’s personal feelings and to personalise the song for Taylor.
Adam and Taylor had previously met through email and had been communicating for some time, and the pair met again at a party. This party is described fully in detail during the song and describes Taylor’s childful infatuation with Adam.
Hearing this song, Adam wrote this as a response to Enchanted as a whole, of how he fell in love with Taylor at first sight and shared the same feelings. Along with this, Adam’s signature passionate vocals and electronic production give this song a very powerful and unique sound.
Taylor never replied to Adam’s gesture, and this song was removed from the blog post after a few months. Taylor then began dating Jake Gyllenhall and Adam stopped pursuing the matter.
Most of the song’s annotations and meanings can be found on the original version  of “Enchanted” on Country Genius.",Enchanted

Ah, ah","“exile” describes two ex-lovers seeing each other following a break-up. Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.
The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.
“exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.",​exile

Taylor explained a bit about what the word “fearless” means to her in the album booklet:
To me, ‘fearless’ is not the absence of fear. It’s not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you’ve been hurt before.

The song was inspired by her recent break up with Joe Jonas. She described it as a song about a relationship with a man who she could feel was “slowly slipping away.”
It’s about watching somebody fade away in a relationship. They said they were going to be with you forever, that they loved you, and then something changed in the relationship and you don’t know what it is, but you’re watching them slowly drift. That emotion of rejection, for me, usually starts out sad and then gets mad. This song starts with this pretty melody that’s easy to sing along with, then in the end I’m basically screaming it because I’m so mad. I’m really proud of that.
The song talks about holding on to every moment with him, since things won’t last.
On the Platinum Editon of the album, the song was redone with a softer piano melody.

In shades of gray in candlelight

Like on her 2014 track “Wonderland,” she includes a pop-culture reference to connect her experiences to something that listeners are familiar with, adding another layer of livelihood to the story.
Co-writer Jack Antonoff, also known by his stage name Bleachers, has released a song called “Rollercoaster” that contains similar melodies and another shotgun metaphor.",Getaway Car

I say, ""Believe in one thing, I won't go away""","On the passionate winter ballad dubbed “Forever Winter,” Swift sings about her constant worry and stress over the actions of her friend. The heartfelt track describes Taylor’s anxiety regarding a loved one who suffers from a mental illness, most likely depression, and her desperation about wanting to be a summer sun — a warm piece of light — in their life, which, at the time, felt like the winter: cold and dark.
This song is highly rumoured to be about Swift’s old high school friend, Jeff Lang, who was struggling with addiction and mental health issues. He died two weeks after the release of her third studio album, Speak Now and, the day after his funeral, Swift attended the BMI Awards and dedicated the award she won to Jeff, saying:
Yesterday, I sang at the funeral of one of my best friends and he was 21, and I used to play my songs for him first, so I would like to thank Jeff Lang.

The man in Taylor’s attention is so impossibly attractive, she feels compelled to be with him even though she already has a boyfriend. The song seems to play with the rumors that Taylor cheated on Calvin Harris with Tom Hiddleston in 2016. Furthermore, the chorus seems to mock the perception that most of Taylor’s discography is comprised of lighthearted, simple songs about boys.
As the third song released from reputation, it was first teased on October 19, 2017, when Taylor posted a short snippet of the track on Instagram. She also hosted a secret album listening party at her home in Rhode Island for a handpicked selection of fans the night before. Some of these fans, along with those who attended the London Secret Session the week before, took to social media to express their love for the song.
Fans have speculated the song is about Taylor’s rumored boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn. During the Rhode Island secret session, she told fans that this song and all the other positive love songs on the album are about him. Although they are not allowed to say much until the album comes out, she wanted her fans to clarify this in online discussions. She also liked multiple posts on Tumblr about this subject as further confirmation.",Gorgeous

Tim McGraw tells a story in which a not-so-great driver is distracted, and turns on the radio, which happens to be playing a nonexistent Taylor Swift song, to tune out her thoughts. Keith Urban plays a guitar solo towards the end of the track.
Funnily, Taylor’s first big hit was called “Tim McGraw.”

Although she has been driven to the edge of hopelessness by her lover, Taylor is unable to let go of her doomed relationship.
According to an interview with co-writer Aaron Dessner, “hoax” and “the 1” were the final songs written after the rest of the album was completed, and the two agreed that they should be added to the record as “bookends”. Musically, the song shares some similarities to “cardigan,” the second track of folklore.
Additionally, in conversation with Dessner during folklore: the long pond studio sessions, Swift stated that the song was her first time exploring multiple themes in one piece:
I think I said, “What if not all of these feelings are about the same person? What if I’m writing about several different, very fractured situations? Like one is about love, and one is about a business thing that really hurt, and one is about a sort of relationship that I considered family, but that really hurt.” […] I definitely had the moment of doubt. I had the moment of like, “I don’t usually do this, I usually know exactly what I’m writing about,” and I was really happy when you kind of pushed me forward, like, “Nope, do the thing that makes you uncomfortable.”",​hoax

Taylor contacted him and he agreed to produce the song. As a result, “Holy Ground” sounds different from any of Taylor’s previous work.
In the song, Taylor is looking back at a whirl wind relationship from her past. She’s realizing just because the relationship didn’t last, doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good memory or that it was wasted time. The memories are still important and sacred. Just because Taylor and the guy weren’t meant to be, doesn’t mean she can’t look back fondly at the time they spent together. Every mistake is a lesson learned.
The song’s hidden message is “When you came to the show in SD” which leads to assumption that this song was penned about Joe Jonas who was spotted at Taylor’s San Diego show during the Speak Now tour

“I Almost Do'” is a song I wrote about the conflict that you feel when you want to take someone back, and you want to give it another try, but you know you can’t. And you can’t because you know it’s hurt you so deeply that you know that you couldn’t bear to go through that again. So you’re sitting there and wondering where they are and hope that they think about you and that you’re almost picking up the phone call, but you just can’t. I think I needed to write this song in order to not call that person actually. I think that writing the song was what I did instead of picking up the phone.
The same relationship she wrote this song about left her so emotional that she suffered six months of writing block prior to being able to begin writing Red, as she mentioned to USA Today.
There’s a kind of bad that gets so overpowering you can’t even write about it. When you feel pain that is so far past dysfunctional, that leaves you with so many emotions that you can’t filter them down to simple emotions to write about. That’s when you know you really need to get out.
The hidden message written in the album for “I Almost Do” reads, “Wrote this instead of calling.”",I Almost Do

With similar themes, this song is reminiscent of her 2017 reputation track, “Dress,” which delved into her sexual admiration of her now ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. Although this track does not seem to address anyone in particular and was originally written around 2010 for the first version of Swift’s Speak Now album, it emphasizes Taylor’s recent use of rock and alternative sonics.
The blend of synthesizer, guitar and bass mash up to create a rather new and fresh sound to Taylor. The experimental sound, in which Swift also later went on to dive into throughout albums like 2017’s reputation and 2022’s Midnights, have always made Swift’s discography as a whole interesting to listen to. Especially around the time her 2014 album, 1989, in which she fully embraced Pop music and Pop influences in her songs, she talked about how she always wanted to be experimental with her art – during a 2015 interview for extratv, she said:
I think that it’s important to experiment with different things. I think that the direction you wanna go musically, it has to surprise people. There are a lot of my songwriting that I haven’t explored yet.
“I Can See You” is a magnetic blend of atmospheric production, enticing melodies, and Taylor Swift’s signature storytelling prowess. It captures the essence of longing, secrecy, and the undeniable attraction between two souls who dance on the edge of temptation.",I Can See You (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault]

The song is performed as a duet between music sensations ZAYN and Taylor Swift. Swift also co-wrote the song with producers Jack Antonoff and Sam Dew.
The track is Taylor Swift’s first release in 2016 besides singles from her fifth album 1989. Meanwhile, it’s one of many for ZAYN, who dropped his debut album Mind of Mine in March of that year.
Swift first revealed the track on her social media accounts, debuting the single art and a clip from the song on Instagram. Zayn later posted a photo on Instagram with Swift under the caption “#IDontWannaLiveForever.”

I bet you think about me","In “I Bet You Think About Me,” Taylor confronts her ex now that she was able to move on, knowing he still hasn’t. Using an angry and disappointed tone, Taylor puts the blame on her lover for leaving for superficial reasons, which included differences in background and upbringing.
The subject of the song is probably Jake Gyllenhaal, who Taylor dated back in 2010. Although Taylor was brought up in Pennsylvania on her family’s farm before moving to Tennesee as she grew older, Jake was born to a film producer and screenwriter, with an entirely different upbringing from Taylor.
The song was initially teased with the Vault track video Taylor posted in hint of the vault tracks for the re-recorded album. On October 15, 2021, Taylor secretly released a message on Apple Music, which contained a spoken 31-second track, and the fully confirmed track list. Fans noticed “I Bet You Think About Me” was labeled “explicit,” leading fans to believe the snippet from the vault is this song.
In the music video, Swift portrays herself as her ex’s vision of her on his wedding day. Her ex, who is impersonated by Miles Teller, keeps seeing Swift and the color red, an indication that he is still thinking about her, even on his own wedding.  As he dances with her while she wears in a wedding dress, his world turns to the color red and he realizes she is not real, and that she is the embodiment of his recurrent thoughts about her. It’s interesting to point out that the music video was co-written and produced by Blake Lively, one of Swift’s best friends. The music video has several easter eggs, most notably the cake, Red’s promotional ring and most importantly the iconic scarf Swift offered to the bride. One last fun fact is the bride in the video being Teller’s real-life wife, Keleigh Sperry.",I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault]

With its sound playing between electropop and dubstep, this song marks the significant period in which Swift began to move further away from her country roots and into more pop influences. TIME congratulated Swift on being “the first major artist to fuse country and dubstep.”
It was originally released on October 9, 2012 as the third promo single from Red, and later as an official single on November 27, 2012.
The song was an international commercial success, charting as a top ten hit in more than a dozen countries. In the U.S., it debuted at number three, mainly due to digital sales of 416,000. Later, it peaked at number two, becoming one of her many top-two hits including “You Belong with Me” and “Today Was a Fairytale.”. As of 2019, the song has sold 5.42 million copies in the United States.
The hidden message for the track is “When you saw me dancing”, which leads to speculation that the song is about Harry Styles — whom Taylor is said to have first met backstage at the 2012 Kids Choice Awards.
Her and Selena Gomez were seen dancing to One Direction’s performance of “What Makes You Beautiful”.

It allows her to formally conclude those situations, contextualize the following track, “Cruel Summer,” and focus on the true theme of the album: the several types of love she experiences in her life.

How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing

So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else""
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""
I Know Places

The song is about Taylor and her best friend Abigail Anderson. It speaks volumes of how they know each other so well and feel free to be themselves when they are together. The video features Abigail and other of Swift’s friends and family. It has a laid-back setting and shows a more family oriented side of her.
Even though the song is about Abigail, the video implies that she loves her family deeply, and would be nothing without them.

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile","The thirteenth track on Taylor Swift’s eponymous debut album  finds her lamenting on someone who doesn’t even notice her.
People have theorized that the song is about Drew Hardwick, the person who inspired “Teardrops On My Guitar,” where she also conveys a similar feeling of longing for a boy she likes as she talks about not being able to sleep at night because of him.
It has never been confirmed, but in an email exchange about her summer days at Jersey Shore, she said that she was inspired to write this song as she looked back on one of the summers she spent there.
She frequented the Shore until she was about fourteen years old, which was also the same age she was when she was in love with Drew. (It was her freshman year in high school at the time). If this song was inspired by her last summer at the shore, which would’ve been right after her freshman year, the dates would line up perfectly to further indicate that this song is about Drew.
The song is also comparable to “You Belong With Me,” in that in both songs the boy is dating a girl who isn’t as good for him as Taylor would be.",Invisible

The chorus asks if the relationship has truly ended, touching on intimate moments and the pain of betrayal.

Jack Antonoff

The secret message for this song is “forever and always” which is a callback to a song penned about her break-up with Joe. While “Forever & Always” highlights the angry, confused emotions she felt when he left her, “Last Kiss” highlights the sort of melancholy, nostalgic sadness that follows; the gloomy calm after the storm. She reflects on their relationship together, and how in those moments she never thought it would end.
The song has a 27 second intro, which could possibly reflect the 27 second break up phone call she had with Joe Jonas.

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me

I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world [Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid

I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you [Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through

Having mostly escaped the public eye during her relationship with Alwyn, Swift finally shares some of the most memorable experiences she’s enjoyed.
This track is notable for using an interpolation of the rhythm on Cautious Clay’s “Cold War,” making Clay only the second artist ever to be interpolated on one of Swift’s songs (after Right Said Fred on “Look What You Made Me Do”).",London Boy

The interviewer described the song as a “romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget.” Swift announced the song’s release date during an acceptance speech at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards. Three days later, the song appeared on iTunes, revealing that it’s the third track on the album.
The song is a romantic track dedicated to Swift’s partner of three years, Joe Alwyn. It takes a wedding-like perspective on their relationship and shares information about their romance. A Twitter user who attended one of the secret sessions alleged that “‘Lover’ is Taylor’s favorite [original] song of all time,” having asked her directly during a Q&A.
On the day of its release, “Lover” reached number #1 on the US iTunes charts, making it her 35th song to do so. With this milestone, she extends her record as the female with the most #1 singles in iTunes' history.
The music video for the song was released on August 22, 2019, immediately following Swift’s Lover’s Lounge on YouTube. It features Swift and her love interest in a house inside a snow globe, illustrating the ups and downs of a relationship in progress. During Swift’s livestream, she further revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her 1989 song, “You Are In Love”:

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you","Taylor was inspired to write “Love Story” when she was going through a difficult situation with a boy she liked, whom she wasn’t “officially” dating. The song has been rumored to be about two singers – the first being Joe Jonas, since it was recorded in March of 2008, just a few months before she began actually dating him. Other songs such as “Forever & Always” and “Last Kiss” are more explicitly about him.
The second rumored subject of the song is Boys Like Girls front-man, Martin Johnson whom Swift had a brief fling with in 2008 and collaborated with to pen the band’s track “Two is Better Than One” and Taylor’s song “If This Was a Movie”. This is a fitting match for the “star-crossed lovers” theme of the song as sources claimed that although the pair were into each other, Taylor’s publicists felt he was not a good match for her “American sweetheart” image – with him being a punk rocker who was going through personal issues at the time.
She chose to portray the story of Romeo and Juliet in the song, because she felt like she could relate.
I used to be in high school where you see [a boyfriend] every day. Then I was in a situation where it wasn’t so easy for me, and I wrote this song because I could relate to the whole Romeo and Juliet thing.
The lyrics talk about disapproval against the relationship, and her desire to go somewhere far away with him, and escape the people who look down on them.
“Love Story” peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs, and at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, just weeks after its release.

The song’s music video was described as timeless, by Swift.
‘Love Story’’s plot was a timeless scenario: I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008
The video won the CMT Music Awards for “Video of the Year,” as well as “Female Video of the Year.”

In February 2021, “Love Story” became the first official re-release from Taylor’s backcatalog following contractual disputes with Scooter Braun. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in her career as she sought autonomy and freedom from what she perceived as a manipulative business relationship.",Love Story

Some of the story may originate from Rebekah Harkness, who Swift based earlier folklore track “the last great american dynasty” on.",​mad woman

Swift released the song as a single in March 2011, and its accompanying music video was directed by Declan Whitebloom, who also directed the music video for “Ours.” The video includes cameos from actress Joey King and singer-songwriter Presley Cash, who both play people experiencing bullying.
The song received positive reviews from outlets like Entertainment Weekly, and won two Grammy awards — Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.",Mean

Marjorie, who passed in 2003, was an opera singer and helped inspire Taylor to pursue music. In the album notes, Marjorie is credited with background vocals.
Given that evermore also has a track titled “dorothea,” fan speculation suggests that this song may also allude to the story of Marjorie West, a four year-old girl who disappeared in Pennsylvania, where Swift grew up. Dorothea was the name of Marjorie West’s sister, and was reportedly the last person to see her before she went missing.",​marjorie

She revealed the song’s title and track number in the first video of her TikTok game Midnights Mayhem With Me on September 21st, 2022. Swift reaffirms that she thinks that she and her long-time partner actor Joe Alwyn were meant for each other, but she also schemed and made up a plan to ensure that they would be together. Once she admits this to her lover, he just smiles because he already knew that something like that was in her nature.
All’s well that ends well to end up with you.
The title is also a nod to her fans calling Swift a “mastermind” for her careful planning of Easter eggs and releases.",Mastermind

It’s a stark turn from her sixth studio album, reputation, released in 2017, which is known for its dark visuals and mature themes.
After a YouTube credits leak the day before its release, the collaboration was confirmed by Swift herself when she appeared with Robin Roberts on ABC. Before Swift went on air, a Spotify billboard in London, England began to promote the track.
The music video for the song gained 65.2 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest 24-hour debut for a female or solo artist on the platform, as well as breaking the record for the biggest 24-hour VEVO debut, which she previously achieved with “Look What You Made Me Do.” It also broke the record for most first-day plays on US pop radio, another record previously held by “LWYMMD.”

Although frightening, this new infatuation carries with it hopes of being true love. The song seems to be connected thematically to “Come Back… Be Here,” which talks about Swift struggling to have a long-distance relationship with someone. It is rumored that the subject of both songs is Harry Styles, whom Swift dated towards the end of 2012.
A “message in a bottle” is a form of communication used by castaways looking for rescue. Similarly, Taylor uses it to express her readiness for commitment to someone seemingly far away for now, specifically in “London,” conveniently being the capital city of Harry Styles' home country. With the outro’s lyrics differing from those in the chorus, it seems that this song is an actual “message in a bottle” to her potential lover.
The song’s pop sound, with an upbeat tempo brought on by drums and a guitar, is very familiar to songs on Swift’s 1989. The similarities between this song and ones on 1989 make sense, since this is the first track Taylor wrote with Max Martin and Shellback. Both producers contributed on many songs on 1989, most notably “Wildest Dreams,” “Style,” “Blank Space” and “Shake It Off.”",Message In A Bottle (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault]

Like “ME!” and “The Man,” this song was produced by Joel Little. It’s the darkest-sounding song he worked on for the album, and it’s reminiscent of Lorde’s 2013 album Pure Heroine, which he also produced.",Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince

The song allegedly refers to Joe Jonas, who Taylor was dating at the time, and has since moved on. Joe is now married to Sophie Turner, who showed her admiration for the song, regardless of what it discusses, to which Taylor then replied, proving it’s all good between all parties.
The track has hallmarks in both sound and lyrics from her Fearless era. The upbeat drums accompanied with subtle rock inspired guitars and analogue synths underneath a song about naïve love and heartbreak that causes more inconvenience and annoyance than it does pain are staples of that era.
Taylor released this “From the Vault” song as a surprise promotional single at 9:00 AM EDT on April 7th, two days before the release date of Fearless (Taylor’s Version).",Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault]

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you

And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots [Pre-Chorus]
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too

Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said

So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off

Just never grow up","“Never Grow Up” is track number eight off Taylor Swift’s third album, Speak Now.
She wrote the song when she was in her late teens, but during one of her performances, she dedicated it to the baby of one of her dear friends, model Jamie King, after she made Taylor the godmother.
I wrote it when I was like 18 or 19, but my friend just had a baby and she made me godmother of it and I was holding this little baby the other night, and I was just thinking differently. When you’re holding onto something that’s so innocent and so perfect and has no idea what’s coming for it with the world. The world is going to throw so many things at you as we grow up.

King wasn’t at the performance, but she was touched by it after seeing a video clip, to which she responded via Twitter.

I don't need you now","“Need You  Now” is one of the many leaked unreleased songs by Taylor Swift from her early years as a a young singer-songwriter in Nashville. Written by Swift in her teens, the song was co-written with one of her early collaborators, Robert Ellis Orall, who also co-wrote with Swift and Angelo Petragalia on the album track from her eponymous debut album, “A Place In This World”.
The song is about moving on from someone who couldn’t reciprocate the love, patience and respect you have invested in the relationship despite this person trying to win you back again by connecting with your common friends and personally paying you a visit to your house.
“Need You Now” is another one of those ironic Taylor Swift song titles such as “Forever & Always”, from the 2010 GRAMMY Album of the Year awardee, “Fearless”, as the song depicts someone confronting an ex-partner and declaring that they actually no longer need them and their broken promises and neglect of the relationship.
Fans have noticed the song’s similarities to Swift’s acclaimed album track, “All Too Well”, from her fourth studio album, “RED”.",Need You Now

Look at how my tears ricochet","Swift shared via Instagram that “my tears ricochet” is about an “embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession.” She revealed in a YouTube livechat that it was the first song she wrote for folklore.
Some fans believe it connects to Swift’s personal life as well — with the song really being about Scott Borchetta’s betrayal of Swift when she left Big Machine records for Republic.
In addition, on August 2017’s “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift infamously proclaimed “the old Taylor” dead. The prominent funeral imagery makes it sound like Swift may be mourning this metaphorical murder.",​my tears ricochet

The best people in life are free","“New Romantics” is a satirical song discussing how “new romantics” view love and life. It addresses the nonchalant and whimsical nature of the way young adults approach love. Notably, Taylor doesn’t segregate herself from these young adults. Her constant use of personal pronouns such as “we” and “I” indicate that she has also embraced this mindset.
In past albums, Taylor approached love from very extreme stances namely:

Extremely idealistically i.e. “Love Story”

A bitter or angry reponse to breakups i.e “Picture to Burn”

An extremely heartbroken, torn apart stance i.e. “Dear John”


However, this album introduces Taylor’s new mindset and approach towards love. We see her transition through a breakup and making the discovery that love is not a fairytale, and the chances of a happy ending is very unlikely – so it’s better to live life freely and not take relationships too seriously. Notably, the album begins with “Welcome to New York,” which marks the beginning of her transition, and this song, as the last track on the deluxe edition, indicates how she will be heading into the future – free falling.

Taylor recognizes that when the ‘parties’ in her life are over and the ‘new year’ begins, such memories are all she will have left to hold on to and learn from. She relates a lasting love to someone who shares a midnight kiss with you on New Year’s, but who still stays with you the next morning for the aftermath of the party and begins the new year together with you.
Musically, the song is reminiscent of Taylor’s older tracks, with sparse production and simply guitar and piano as backing. Contrasting many prior songs on the album where Taylor takes shots at various people, she creates a more mature image here–thankful for her past and ready to ‘clean up’ and move on in the future.",New Year’s Day

According to Variety, Swift wrote the song following the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans won most votes. This was the first election where Swift broke her infamous political silence — she publicly endorsed two Democrats in a post on Tumblr and Instagram before Election Day.
The song debuted at #1 on the US iTunes chart, making it Swift’s 38th song to do this, and extending her record as the artist with the most #1s in US iTunes history.",Only The Young

The song ends on a note of acceptance and a newfound sense of self, with Swift telling herself that no longer talking to her partner is how it has to be.

It was the second promo single released from 1989, and later became the sixth official single. It was co-written by Jack Antonoff of Fun. and Bleachers, who worked on many songs for the album, and later joined Taylor to create her 2017 album reputation. It is known that she was writing to track for this song, something she was not used to at the time.
A short preview of the song was shown on Good Morning America on October 13th, 2014, and the full version was released the next day. The song’s music video was premiered on December 31st, 2015, during ABC’s annual Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin' Eve broadcast.
The song’s hidden message is, “They loved each other recklessly.”
The blue dress that Taylor Swift wore in the music video made a return at the beginning of the 2017 “Look What You Made Me Do” music video:

Swift has shared the concept of this song at the secret sessions with some fans:
The whole song is just basically reminiscing on fun memories. And then in the chorus, it talks about how […], your whole life you talk with your friends about how, like, ‘Oh my God. Do you wanna get married? What do you want your ring to look like? What kind of ring do you want?’ I don’t know, I just feel like if you really love someone, love someone, you’d be like, ‘I don’t care.’ And so, it talks about that concept as the hook.",Paper Rings

It was included on Taylor Swift due to its popularity with her classmates. However, Swift herself never assumed it would even be on an album.
Taylor talked to The Boot about the story behind the song:
I wrote this song in my freshman year of high school, for my ninth grade talent show. So I was sitting there thinking, “I’ve gotta write a song that’s gonna relate to everyone in the talent show, and it’s gotta be upbeat.” And at that time, I was dating a guy, and we didn’t have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one, and I played it at the talent show at the end of the year.
The uptempo track is musically driven mainly by banjo and lyrically describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song.

Ronan’s mother, Maya Thompson, who gets credit as a co-writer on the song, wrote about Ronan’s journey and the progression of his illness on a blog called Rockstar Ronan, which she now uses to write letters to Ronan about her life and his siblings.
Little did Maya know, Swift stumbled on the blog around the time Ronan died. She  invited Maya backstage at her 2011 Speak Now Tour and they exchanged contact information. Shortly after, Swift told Maya she wrote “Ronan” as a tribute to her son and wanted to perform the song at a 2011 awareness fundraiser for Stand Up To Cancer. Maya recalled the phone call in a 2012 blog post:
‘I wrote a song for Ronan,’ [Taylor] said. The tears started pouring down my cheeks as soon as I heard her say those words. But her words didn’t stop there. Not only did she write a song for you, but she wanted to know if it would be alright to perform it on the nationally televised Stand Up 2 Cancer show which is on every major network and is seen in over 100 countries. She wanted to know if she could use a picture of you in the background while she sang the song. She wanted to make me co-author of the song with her. She talked about how reading this blog and following our story has inspired her, and how amazing she thinks I am and all I am doing to bring awareness to childhood cancer.
Swift has only performed “Ronan” a few times in her whole career, once on the Stand Up to Cancer telethon and a second time when the Thompson family went to her 1989 Tour in 2015. After meeting with the Thompson family, Swift asked if she could perform “Ronan” in his honor that night, and Maya wrote about the evening on her blog. Maya mentioned that she felt Ronan’s presence during the song, which she usually couldn’t listen to without sobbing.
Notably, Swift’s mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, shortly before she performed “Ronan” at the 1989 Tour — her battle inspired Swift’s raw 2019 song “Soon You’ll Get Better.”
After Big Machine Records sold Swift’s masters to mogul Scooter Braun in 2019, Maya expressed her fear and disappointment about Braun owning “Ronan” in two tweets. In July 2021, Maya announced on her blog that Swift rerecorded “Ronan” for Red (Taylor’s Version), allowing them to regain control of Ronan’s story.
All proceeds from “Ronan” went to charities that help fund cancer research, including the Thompson family’s own foundation they founded in Ronan’s name.",Ronan

The haunting song was written by Swift and features the duo The Civil Wars with their signature intricate harmonies.

The line “so it goes” originates from the novel Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, written in 1969. He says the line several times in the novel whenever a death occurs, as a narrative transition to another subject.

This could be symbolic to Swift’s reputation album as a whole, since she has publicly said the “old Taylor” is dead. This album is her transition into the “new” Taylor – so it goes.
Taylor’s use of the phrase could also mean something similar to “That’s life; life goes on.” Even when they “break down a little,” she and her boyfriend are still secure in their relationship and they still keep trying.",So It Goes...

Lyrically, the song serves as a warning for what love can be – both amazing and devastating. Essentially it can go both ways, depending on how we go about it.
Throughout the song, we see Swift detailing the beginning of a love with all its possibilities, as well an utterly romantic sentiment and charm about the uncertainty and expectations that come along with any new beginning.",State of Grace

Swift talked a little bit about the meaning behind this song.
After hearing my songs, a lot of people ask me, “How many boyfriends have you had?‘” And I always tell them that more of my songs come from observation than actual experience. In other words, you don’t have to date someone to write a song about them. This is a song I wrote about a guy I never dated! Wow, right? This song is about a guy I thought was cute, and never really talked to him much. But something about him inspired this song, just watching him.",Stay Beautiful

Starlight is a song I wrote actually after seeing a picture of um, Ethel and Bobby Kennedy when they were seventeen. I saw this picture about a year a half ago, and I didn’t know anything about like, what they were doing or what was going on in the picture, but I just thought ‘They look like they’re having the best night.’ And, um, and so I wrote this song about what the night might’ve been like. And um, I ended up meeting Ethel and going and playing it for her and she just loved it. It was such a fun moment when she was just in love with the song and so happy about it and um, it’s just this adorable picture that to me, it just like brought forth all these potentials for how that night could’ve been.

The song follows Taylor’s simple gratitude and love of the life that she has built with boyfriend Joe Alwyn. Swift speaks of how she finds peace in her romantic relationship with her partner who asks “sweet nothing” of her as opposed to the pressures she faces from the media, a topic Swift has written about frequently, namely in her 2017 album reputation and the Midnights lead single “Anti-Hero”.
The song is written by Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn under the alias, William Bowery. This is not the first time that Alwyn/Bowery has been featured as a writer on one of Swift’s tracks. Bowery has writing credits on folklore’s track 4, “exile”, and track 14 “betty”, and evermore’s “champagne problems”, “coney island”, and the titular closing track “evermore”.",Sweet Nothing

It was originally written for Swift’s sophomore album, Fearless, but was cut. In April 2021 it was one of the “From the Vault” tracks on Swift’s re-release of Fearless.
The demo version was sung only by Swift, with notably different lyrics, and Swift in the position of needing to decide whether to take back the other person in the relationship. Swift has previously performed with Urban and opened for him on tour, and he covered her 2019 ballad “Lover”.",That’s When (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault]

Combat, I'm ready for combat","“The Archer” is a mid-tempo track about Swift’s insecurities in a relationship. It’s the third song released from 2019’s Lover, preceded by “ME!” and “You Need To Calm Down.”
Swift first teased “The Archer” in the music video for “ME!,” which features a scene with a band of Cupid-esque angels—Cupid is often depicted as an archer, who shoots arrows at people to make them fall in love. Swift later teased it more directly in the music video for “You Need To Calm Down,” when Hayley Kiyoko shot an arrow into a target with a 5 on it.
“The Archer” follows what Swift’s fans deem the “Track #5 Theory,” which surmises that some of Swift’s most vulnerable, emotional tracks are the fifth track on their respective albums.
There’s also a potential connection with the song’s title and Swift’s zodiac sign. Born on December 13, 1989, Swift is a Sagittarius; otherwise known as the archer sign.",The Archer

In 2013, Swift bought a Rhode Island mansion once owned by Rebekah Harkness. The mansion is known as “Holiday House.”
Taylor draws subtle comparisons between herself and Rebekah Harkness in the song. She likens her star-studded parties to the bevy of famous composers and and dancers that once frequented Holiday house in Harkness' days.  Also similar to Taylor Swift, Rebekah Harkness was often a target of harsh criticism from the tabloids, and people alike.
This song is reminiscent of “The Lucky One” from her album Red where Taylor Swift sang of an unnamed Hollywood star who moved away from the limelight and from under the microscope of the media, into a life of solitude.
The style of the song follows Taylor Swift’s familiar contemporary pop sound. She spends most of the song singing in a low octave, transitioning to a higher octave only towards the end of the song. The song has elements of folk music in it too, matching the overall theme of the album.",​the last great american dynasty

The relationship has been very on and off and as “We Are Never Getting Back Together” says in a funny, mocking way, this song sincerely and rawly states – this is the last time. Swift has finally had enough of this relationship, the uncertainty, and the hurt.
In the hidden message of this track in the album cover Swift wrote: “LA on Break”. This seems to hint that this person may have broken up with her while he was in LA on his break. Perhaps in Hollywood on a break from acting. This may be pointing at Taylor’s ex, actor Jake Gyllenhaal. The pair broke up after he did not pitch to her birthday, as he was in LA to promote his movie Love and Other Drugs. This was detailed in her track “The Moment I Knew.”",The Last Time

Swift reportedly wrote this song in Australia, and although she doesn’t say who the song is about (she set a rule against this herself), the song is rumored to be about Joni Mitchell and Kim Wilde, the lyrics: “They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere, chose the rose garden over Madison Square.” could possibly be referencing how Wilde left her career to become a landscape gardener. The main melody is also sampled from Wilde’s “Four Letter Word”

Taylor explains:
It’s a thought experiment of sorts: ‘If I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read?’
On January 27, 2020, the song was confirmed by Billboard’s Senior Director of Charts, Gary Trust, as the fourth official single off of Lover after it was sent to both pop and adult pop radio.",The Man

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she talked about this song:
It’s about what I was going through at the time. I was a complete outcast at school and never fit in, never felt like I belonged. A lot of times back then when I was 12 or 13, I would write songs about relationships, when I wasn’t in relationships, because I would look at other people and try to observe what they were going through. But in the case of ”The Outside,” I was writing exactly what I saw. I was writing from pain. And I’ve always felt so lucky, because I’ve never needed an escape like drinking or drugs or anything like that to escape from the bad days. Music has always been that escape for me.",The Outside

The end","Swift wrote “The Story of Us” after an awkward encounter with ex John Mayer at the 2010 CMT Music Awards, where both parties tried to ignore each other’s presence. She told USA Today that she came up with the song concept after returning home from the event, after telling her mom she felt like she was “standing alone in a crowded room” throughout the evening.
Swift released the song as the fourth single from Speak Now in April 2011, and the music video came out the next month. Swift recruited Noble Jones to direct the video, which they filmed in the library at Vanderbilt University.
The hidden message for this song was “CMT Awards” in the album booklet, leading fans to speculate that the subject of this song is ex John Mayer, who attended the 2010 awards show.",The Story Of Us

Fear, alcohol, and a sense of failure and isolation complicate the healing process, but she takes the first step by having the humility to admit things are difficult and uncertain.
October 2014’s “I Wish You Would,” another collaboration with Jack Antonoff, offers a similar narrative with parallels in imagery and language (driving cars, flashbacks, anger, and regrets), but here she is more proactively taking risks and putting herself out there, even though she still doesn’t have the perfect solution.",​this is me trying

During the Secret Sessions held before the release of reputation, Taylor told fans that this song drew on her experiences with fame and the media. She stated that she’d throw extravagant parties and invite her friends on stage with her during the 1989 tour as a nice gesture, to share her success with those around her. However, the media eventually turned that against her, questioning and criticizing her need for a “squad” which led her to essentially move out of the public eye completely and go on a sabbatical for the next year.

Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s bad, but regardless, it’s still love. It also explores on the idea of fate — a quite common thread throughout Swift’s whole discography —: If a relationship is not supposed to happen at this point in time, you have to let the other person go, even if you don’t want to, and if it’s meant to be, they’ll eventually come back to your life.
Following the release of 1989, Swift told Yahoo! that she considers “This Love” to be the first song in which she really experimented with different vocal recording styles. She goes on to explore more of that side of music in her following album: 2017’s reputation.
As documented by a Tumblr user, this was the first song Swift have written to 1989, right after she dropped her 2012 album Red, and started out with the chorus as a short poem written in her book.
Additionally, despite having writing credits in all of the songs in the album, “This Love” is the only one she wrote all by herself.",This Love

There are a couple songs on the album like that, that are just watching other people and making observations. But most of the songs on the album are about actual people that have been in my life. I tend to be kind of blatantly obvious, and with my songs, I’ll even mention names a lot of times.

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless [Verse 2]
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
[Chorus]
In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless [Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""
[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""
[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

And somethin' in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in","In the nostalgic “Timeless,” the narrator ruminates on the idea of fate, wistfully imagining herself and her lover throughout time. The song is ultimately about a love so powerful that it would still come to fruition even under circumstances that made it close to impossible to exist.
Reminiscent of her classic country songs, including “Untouchable (Taylor’s Version)” and “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version),” the mixture of piano, drums and guitar creates a sentimental and historic tone to the song. In an effort to detail the inevitable occurrence of her love story, the rhythm and tempo of the music accelerates each time in the chorus.
The lyric video depicts photos and videos of her grandmother and grandfather, showcasing their love story in small fragments. This notes the second time Taylor mentioning and detailing parts of her grandparents life. She first introduced her grandmother on evermore’s “marjorie”, while tributing her grandfather on folklore’s “epiphany.”",Timeless (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault]

At the time, she was dating a senior named Drew Dunlap and believed they would break up before he left for college, so she wrote this song hoping to memorialize their time together.
The Tim McGraw song in question was 2004’s “Can’t Tell Me Nothin'.” Taylor got to perform the song for a crowd Tim was in at the 2007 ACMs. The two later collaborated on Tim’s 2013 track “Highway Don’t Care.”
In 2018 Taylor also performed “Tim McGraw” live with Faith Hill and TimMcGraw himself during the Nashville leg of her reputation tour!

In the liner notes of the album, Swift wrote that one of the song storylines on evermore was about “what happens when [Dorothea] comes back [from Hollywood] for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame.” This likely refers to “‘tis the damn season” given the lyrical mentions of both Los Angeles and the winter holidays. Notably, evermore was released two weeks prior to Christmas 2020, making the title timely yet ironic.
Swift also teased the title in an Instagram story two days before she announced the album.

During her interview for Apple Music Awards 2020, Taylor talked about how she wrote this based on the 1938 novel by Daphne du Maurier, Rebecca, stating that she had also felt like the narrator at some point in her life:
When I was reading Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier, I was thinking, “Wow, her husband just tolerates her. She’s doing all these things and she’s trying so hard and she’s trying to impress him and he’s just tolerating her the whole time.” There was a part of me that was relating to that, because at some point in my life, I felt that way.",​tolerate it

This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it","Something that is treacherous is something harmful and possibly deceptive — Taylor uses this word to describe a relationship that might not be the best one for her. The song contains strong sensual undertones and while at no point references directly anything explicitly sexual, some of the lyrics can nonetheless be interpreted as a metaphor for sex. Looking at the song through this lens, it can be seen as Taylor realizing that this relationship is moving extremely fast and might be unhealthy.
There are various rumored subjects of the song including John Mayer and Jake Gyllenhaal. The secret message for “Treacherous” featured in the Red album booklet is “won’t stop ‘til it’s over”, a lyric featured on The Temper Trap song – “Sweet Disposition.”. This song is referenced on “All Too Well” – another song thought to be about Jake.
However, the song is most likely about Harry Styles. Taylor confirmed to USA Today that “Treacherous” and “I Knew You Were Trouble” are about the same person, and hints in “I Knew You Were Trouble” point to Harry being the inspiration.
The biggest hint however lies in the songs hidden clue. The hidden message – “won’t stop ‘til it’s over” – is from the track “Sweet Disposition”. This song also contains the lyrics:
Won’t stop to surrender
Harry had a rendition of this tattooed on his arm in April 2012, around the time he was dating Taylor

Taylor admitted to mocking Harry on his erroneous tattoo and The Temper Trap even recounted in an interview of a time Taylor ran into them:
She was like “Hey”, you know, “I’m a big fan” blah, blah, blah. And she goes “Ah, it’s my boyfriend’s birthday soon I wanna give him a present – here’s a piece of paper, can you please write down the lyrics to ""Sweet Disposition”, sign it, I wanna give it to him. So I had this dilemma in my mind at that point – do I write the wrong lyrics? Do I write the right lyrics? I kept it real, I wrote the right lyrics man… And they broke up soon after.
This seemed to be Harry’s favorite track at the time he dated Taylor (around April 2012) as he tweeted lyrics to the song on multiple occasions.

The pair also collaborated to pen the track “You’ll Always Find Your Way Back Home” for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie.
This song performed well on charts, even reaching number 18 on the Canadian Billboard Hot 100.
The song laments on the singer’s realization that he needs a particular person in his life despite his previous doubts. This reflective, sombre piece is a love story at heart like many of the other tracks on Love Drunk, but takes a more vulnerable and delicate approach than many of the band’s more uptempo, rock songs.
Interestingly, Taylor and Martin are also rumored to have had a brief relationship at the time the song was written.",Two Is Better Than One

Welcome to New York, welcome to New York","The opening track for 1989 introduced the world to a brand new Taylor Swift. After experimenting with electronic pop elements on Red, her country starlet persona was all but gone with the release of 1989.
The title is a literal way for Taylor to welcome fans to her new sound. Paralleling her own move from Nashville to New York, 1989 as an album reflects her new lifestyle—moving from her country roots to the big city with all its glitz and glamour. She told Rolling Stone in September 2014:
I really like my life right now…I love the album I made. I love that I moved to New York. So in terms of being happy, I’ve never been closer to that.
Taylor teased the lyrics on Instagram on October 14, 2014, and it premiered on October 20 to everyone who pre-ordered the album.
As proof of her love for her adopted hometown, all proceeds from sales of the single went to New York City Public Schools. The city also showed love back when they made Taylor a tourism ambassador.
Despite all this, the song had mixed reviews, even being called “the worst NYC anthem of all time.”

I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around [Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now","Swift told Billboard magazine: “It’s one of the songs that I am really proud of on the record because it’s so sparse – it’s guitar, piano and cello. It talks about falling in love and the fairy tales that you are going to have with this person, and then there is that moment where you realize that it is not going to happen. That moment is the most earth shattering moment.”
Of note, “White Horse” was the second song to contribute to Taylor’s streak of 5th song of the album “emotional vulnerable” ballads.",White Horse

Surprisingly, the famous figure who gets the most elaborate attention is Lana Del Rey: Swift flat-out mimics her on “Wildest Dreams,” flitting between a fluttery soprano and deadpan alto, flipping lyrics so Lana — “His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room” — that it’s hard to tell if the song is homage or parody.
-Billboard Magazine
In the US, the song reached number five, becoming her fifth consecutive top ten from 1989.

According to Swift, the beats heard at the beginning of the song resemble her real heartbeats.",Wildest Dreams

During an interview for Apple Music Awards 2020, Swift revealed that she purposefully chose “willow” as the starting track for evermore because she thought the music that Aaron Dessner had written felt “witchy” and “magical” and that was a great vibe to set for the album.
Swift hinted at this song title twice during the folklore era: the first time being a framed willow tree photo in an Instagram post, and the second one being a subtle reference included in a tweet thanking Rolling Stone for ranking folklore as the best album of 2020.",​willow

In Wonderland","“Wonderland” is a bonus track from the Deluxe Edition of 1989. It is a description of a toxic relationship, from beginning to end. It uses the story of Alice In Wonderland as inspiration for the highs and lows of enjoying this state of relationship wanderlust, irrespective of negative consequences.
Taylor posted this lyric teaser on her Instagram in December 2014:
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had. And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad.
Interestingly, Taylor also did a photoshoot with fashion magazine Wonderland in November 2014, with many fans surprised by her different look.

It’s a song I wrote that is loosely based on… I wrote it with my friend Jack Antonoff (of Fun. and Bleachers) who’s dating my friend Lena [Dunham]. Jack sent me this song, it was just an instrumental track he was working on and immediately I knew the song it needed to be. And I wrote it as a kind of commentary on what their relationship has been like. So it’s actually me looking and going and ‘this happened and that happened then that happened’ and that’s how you knew, “You are in love”.

Her second collaboration with producer Joel Little, it’s also the second single from her seventh studio album, Lover.
In the second verse, Swift continues to show her support for the LGBTQ+ community, following a June 2019 letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, as well as a petition she created to fight for legal equality among all people, regardless of sexuality or gender. It’s also significant to note that Swift released the song in June, which is recognized as Pride Month.
A music video for the song was released on June 17, 2019 after its official premiere on Good Morning America. It features cameos from several LGBT celebrities, including Hayley Kiyoko, Laverne Cox, the cast of Queer Eye, and Todrick Hall, who co-executive produced the video. At the end of the video, Katy Perry appears in the midst of a food fight, signifying the end of her “feud” with Swift.
Swift teased the lyric and title “You Need To Calm Down” in the April 2019 music video for “ME!.” In the beginning of the video, Swift argues with featured artist Brendon Urie, and he tells her that she needs to calm down.",You Need To Calm Down

I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

The song was solely written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift’s aid.

You say, ""I don't understand,"" and I say, ""I know you don't""
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow
[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
[Verse 2]
Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick [Pre-Chorus]
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
""You don't know what you got until it's gone""
[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
'Cause you're losin' me
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me
[Post-Chorus]
My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
[Bridge]
How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fadin', thinkin'
""Do something, babe, say something"" (Say something)
""Lose something, babe, risk something"" (You're losin' me)
""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing)
""To believe, unless you're choosin' me"" [Outro]
You're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore","Released only on CD, exclusively available to purchase at Swift’s The Eras Tour, “You’re Losing Me” is a From The Vault track of her tenth studio album, Midnights. The track was also available to purchase for 24 hours on Taylor’s website, but isn’t available on any streaming platforms yet.
The song is rumoured to be detailing Swift’s point of view in the breakup of her six-year long relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.
Interestingly, “You’re Losing Me” is also the second song on Swift’s discography to feature the sample of her own heartbeat — the first time she did it was on her 2014 single, “Wildest Dreams.”",You’re Losing Me (From The Vault)

If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way
[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
[Verse 2]
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us [Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe
[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
[Bridge]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time [Verse 3]
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first
[Chorus]
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
[Outro]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh, God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time","In “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve”, Taylor uses morbid and religious overtones in order to express regret for a youthful relationship that left her deeply scarred. This draws on themes such as those in previous songs “A Perfectly Good Heart” and “Dear John”, where the singer’s naivete was similarly trampled on.
“Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” draws on Taylor’s relationship with John Mayer, which took place when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. The age difference was highly criticized at the time, but the young Taylor stuck to her rebellious guns. Now, with more than a decade of experience accumulated since the end of the relationship, Taylor now regrets it, given its power imbalance, the untimely taking of her innocence, and the lasting trauma she maintains from it. She laments that she was enabled to leap too quickly into things she should have taken her time with.
The song itself is filled with heavy, threatening drums that provide a rock feel, juxtaposed with vocal background harmonies reminiscent of religious choirs. This combines to create an ominous track with sobering associations. Sonically, there is a somewhat comparable feel to Taylor’s earlier songs “Haunted” and “Don’t Blame Me”, albeit with a much different message.","Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve"

Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days
[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
[Verse 2]
I see the great escape,
 
so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away [Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny
, 
I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid [Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been","“You’re On Your Own, Kid” recounts a young person who longs for love but eventually understands that they are on their own as the song progresses toward its conclusion. The verses take you through her younger life and the music builds as she matures through the song.
As the song builds into a frenzy, the audience receive a glimpse into Taylor’s past life: she writes a song, burns the lyrics or letters into ashes. Suddenly, she’s on her own, figuring out how to be herself.
The song utilizes a soft-pulsing percussive beat that slowly blossoms into an alt-pop soundscape. Lyrically and vocally, it sounds like something from Red, but with a darker sheen.
The song parallels Lover’s “It’s Nice To Have a Friend”, also about school kids falling in love. Musically, both have similar, short rhyming couplets.","You’re On Your Own, Kid"
