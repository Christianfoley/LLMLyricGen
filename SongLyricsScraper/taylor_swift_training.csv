I gotta have you","The sixth track on Red finds Taylor Swift celebrating her early twenties by having some (reckless) fun.
The song was written when Taylor Swift celebrated her 22nd birthday. The hidden message in the album booklet is “Ashley, Dianna, Claire, Selena”. These are the four names of some of her friends: Ashley Avignone, stylist, Dianna Agron, actor known for playing Quinn on Glee, Claire Kislinger, jewelry designer, and Selena Gomez, singer / former Disney star, who celebrated her 22nd birthday with her. In fact, Swift tweeted photos of them dressed as hipsters, and they appear in the music video for this track.
The song is however not only about the birthday celebrations but tells the coming-of-age story where she is changing from a teen to an adult. It tells of the confusing times of being in your 20s – where you are “happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time”.",22

The title of this song was teased in Swift’s  music video for her single “Lover”. In the video, a hand plays the words “After” and “Glow,” on a scrabble board.

Notably, the board is titled “King of Hearts,” a nod to “King of My Heart,” which is a song on Swift’s album reputation, hinting that the two songs are about the same person, namely her steady boyfriend of over three years, actor Joe Alwyn.",Afterglow

She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.
Swift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.
Many believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal — the secret message “Maple Lattes” is hidden in the song’s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.
“All Too Well” was the fourth song to contribute to Swift’s “Track Five pattern,” a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were “Cold As You,” “White Horse,” and “Dear John.”",All Too Well

It’s part of Swift’s famous “track five” pattern — through the years, her fans have pointed out her tendency to make the most emotional song on the album the fifth track.
A big theme in Swift’s romantic songs is the prospect of a lover staying with her — see 2012’s “Stay Stay Stay,” 2017’s “New Year’s Day,” and 2019’s “The Archer,” another track five.
Swift gave fans a preview into the lyrics on October 18th, 2014, when she posted this picture on her Instagram:

Largely serving as a parallel to 2019’s “The Archer”, the song shows a darker self-perception from Swift than usual, and goes into detail about what she feels are her personal failures.
The track’s title and track number were revealed in the sixth video of her TikTok game Midnight Mayhem With Me on October 2nd, 2022. The next day, Swift released a ‘Behind The Song’ video to discuss the meaning and purpose behind the track, saying she “struggle[s] a lot with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized"", and described the song as a “guided tour"" of the things she hates about herself.
On Halloween night of 2022, the song was announced to have debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Marking her ninth number one single and fifth number one debut, “Anti-Hero” joined nine other songs from Midnights in constructing the entire top 10 – the first time ever in Billboard history.",Anti-Hero

The track, which fans believe is about actor Jake Gyllenhaal, finds Taylor looking back on a failed relationship. It’s interesting to note that “Better Man,” a song Taylor gave to Little Big Town in 2017, has very similar themes.
Fans have pointed out several connections between “Babe” and other songs written for the Red album, including “All Too Well,” “Girl At Home,” and “The Last Time.”",Babe

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't

The song was Swift’s first to feature orchestral arrangements, the second being fellow Speak Now track- ‘Haunted’.  The song was successful, receiving critical acclaim and peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It went on to win two BMI Awards- ‘Publisher of the Year’ & ‘Award Winning Songs’, as well as a Teen Choice Award for ‘Choice Break-Up Song’.

For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?’ Then last year, the other star crossed a line.
She did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.

Much speculation has been made about who this song is about, with one popular theory suggesting Katy Perry. Perry seemed to think so herself, tweeting the day after the Rolling Stone feature was published:

Swift leaves the sort of loss open to interpretation, but it likely signifies a miscarriage or the loss of a loved one that was gone too soon. Additionally, parallels to “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve”, the nineteenth track of Midnights (3am Edition), imply it could be about Swift ‘losing’ her childhood and innocence after allegedly being groomed by a 32-year-old John Mayer when she was 19.",Bigger Than The Whole Sky

Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs

Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all [Chorus: Taylor Swift]

After the song was announced, many fans were quick to point out lyric parallels between the bridge of this track and her 2008 hit “Love Story,” on which Taylor daydreams about running away with her boyfriend.
In 2019, Taylor reflected on songs like “Call It What You Want” from her album ‘reputation’ as the ones that told the true love story of her relationship.
In her September 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, she tells us that it’s about her “newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on [her] own terms for the first time.”",Call It What You Want

At age sixteen, she was signed to the emerging Big Machine Records, which was the smallest record label in Nashville.  There were only about a dozen employees, and she was the only artist. Despite the unpromising situation, she trusted that the label would eventually rise.
After writing the beginning of it, she let the track rest for a while, waiting for a significant moment in her life that could conclude it. That moment came in 2007 when she won the Horizon Award at the CMAs. After looking out into the audience and seeing her manager Scott Borchetta, crying, she felt like she could finally finish the song, and did so the following day.
That’s when I finished it, because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me.",Change

Christmas tree farms played a significant role in Taylor’s “magical childhood.” Back in March 2009, she spoke to Rolling Stone about her unusual upbringing:

Think I'm finally clean","In an interview with Elle magazine, Taylor said the following about “Clean”:
“Clean” I wrote as I was walking out of Liberty in London. Someone I used to date— it hit me that I’d been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn’t thought about it. When it did hit me, it was like, ‘Oh, I hope he’s doing well’. And nothing else. And you know how it is when you’re going through heartbreak. A heartbroken person is unlike any other person. Their time moves at a completely different pace than ours. It’s this mental, physical, emotional ache and feeling so conflicted. Nothing distracts you from it. Then time passes, and the more you live your life and create new habits, you get used to not having a text message every morning saying, ‘Hello, beautiful. Good morning.’ You get used to not calling someone at night to tell them how your day was. You replace these old habits with new habits, like texting your friends in a group chat all day and planning fun dinner parties and going out on adventures with your girlfriends, and then all of a sudden one day you’re in London and you realize you’ve been in the same place as your ex for two weeks and you’re fine. And you hope he’s fine. The first thought that came to my mind was – I’m finally clean.
“Clean” has a different meaning to fans who’ve had struggles with mental illness, addiction, and abuse – it’s about being quite literally clean. While Taylor didn’t think of that meaning originally, she immediately accepted the fandom-wide meaning once she heard of it.
Taylor gave several inspirational speeches before performing “Clean” during her 1989 World Tour. Taylor said the following before performing “Clean” in Tokyo on May 5th:



The hidden message to Clean is “She lost him, but she found herself, and somehow that was everything.” This song is not just about losing someone you love – it’s also about losing yourself. Being clean is about moving on as a person and really taking care of yourself mentally.",Clean

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day, oh

Counting all the scars you made

I've never been anywhere cold as you
Ooh-oh","“Cold as You” is the fifth track of Swift’s debut album and details her experience with an emotionally unavailable guy. Unlike Shakespeare who compares his lover to a summer’s day Swift compares her lover to a cold, rainy day. She told Rolling Stone that this is her favorite song on the album. In the interview, she said:
The hook is ‘I’ve never been anywhere cold as you.’ I love a line in a song where afterward you’re just like ‘burn.’
Swift penned this song with her frequent collaborator Liz Rose. She explained it in publicity materials:
I wrote this song with Liz, and I think the lyrics to this song are some of the best we’ve ever written. It’s about that moment where you realize someone isn’t at all who you thought they were, and that you’ve been trying to make excuses for someone who doesn’t deserve them. And that some people are just never going to love you. We were halfway through writing this when I started singing ‘And now that I’m sitting here thinking it through, I’ve never been anywhere cold as you’.
Notably, “Cold As You” is responsible for beginning Taylor’s track record of the 5th song of each of her albums being “emotional vulnerable” ballads.",Cold as You

“Come in with the rain” is an old expression meaning that when bad times come, people come to their senses and realize what they wanted was there the whole time. In this song, Taylor is tired of trying to get this guy to like her, so she is just going to wait until he realizes himself that he likes her. She isn’t going to sing songs about him or keep trying to get his attention, but sooner or later he will come to her.",Come In With the Rain

)","“Cruel Summer” narrates the fragility and uncertainty at the beginning of Taylor’s relationship with Joe Alwyn. The two met officially at the Met Gala in May 2016, although she was dating DJ Calvin Harris at the time and started seeing Tom Hiddleston shortly after. The fling between the two likely began soon after, lining up with the summer of 2016. Moreover, Taylor seems to suggest that she secretly fell in love with Joe, who she describes as a “bad boy,” during what was supposed to be a physical relationship.
Swift’s release of Lover comes accompanied with a personal journal, where she describes the summer of 2016 as “the apocalypse,” summarizing how painful it was for her.
Taylor’s vulnerability and the theme of this song is similar to the November 2017 track “Delicate.”",Cruel Summer

Besides the obvious song title, there are multiple references to Mayer directly, including the mention of their over ten-year age gap. Sonically, Taylor purposefully added guitar slurring to the background instrumentals, a guitar playing technique seen all throughout Mayer’s music.
The two notably collaborated on Mayer’s 2010 song “Half of My Heart,” which was released 4 months before “Dear John”.
Besides John’s public statement to Rolling Stone in 2012, Mayer also replied to “Dear John” three years later, in his 2013 song “Paper Doll.” In the song, John directly replies to Taylor’s line, “you paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain” with, “and if those angel wings don’t fly, someone’s going to paint you another sky.”
Notably, “Dear John” was the third song to contribute to Taylor’s streak of having “emotional vulnerable” ballads as the 5th track of an album.",Dear John

The song is written from the perspective of an advice columnist, and in it, Taylor attempts to give the listener (or reader) life advice. She advises the listener to, among other things, be wary, reinvent themselves, bend when they can but not bend over for others who ask of them, and keep secrets. These are all meant not to be trusted, as the narrator themself warns the listener not to. In the song “Dear Reader”, the narrator has come into a very isolated, desperate life, which provides a fitting finale to an album touching on self-doubt, mistrust, and pain throughout.",Dear Reader

As the name implies, many of the sexual references throughout the song pertain to dresses and the main hook of the song is something Swift herself admitted feeling really proud of. Taylor has a history of fascination with dresses dating back to her country music roots from when she first stepped foot in the music industry.
This song is most likely about Swift’s boyfriend at the time it was written, the british actor Joe Alwyn, who is also rumored to be Taylor’s muse for many other songs, especially throughout her 2017 and 2019 albums, reputation and Lover, respectively. The couple dated from 2016 until 2023 and “Dress” seems to be detailing Swift’s point of view from the beginning of their relationship — the bridge, specially, is full with references to when and how they first met.",Dress

Let's assess the situation
That girl was biding her time, yeah, she was waiting on your cue

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Taylor, I was so in love with you","This song is a cover of Taylor Swift’s “Enchanted”, posted to Adam Young’s blog on Valentine’s Day 2011. This version retains most of the lyrics, with some minor changes to reflect Adam’s personal feelings and to personalise the song for Taylor.
Adam and Taylor had previously met through email and had been communicating for some time, and the pair met again at a party. This party is described fully in detail during the song and describes Taylor’s childful infatuation with Adam.
Hearing this song, Adam wrote this as a response to Enchanted as a whole, of how he fell in love with Taylor at first sight and shared the same feelings. Along with this, Adam’s signature passionate vocals and electronic production give this song a very powerful and unique sound.
Taylor never replied to Adam’s gesture, and this song was removed from the blog post after a few months. Taylor then began dating Jake Gyllenhall and Adam stopped pursuing the matter.
Most of the song’s annotations and meanings can be found on the original version  of “Enchanted” on Country Genius.",Enchanted

“Delicate” follows Taylor’s pattern of the fifth song of her albums being one about vulnerable emotions, following previous fifth tracks “Cold As You,” “White Horse,” “Dear John,” “All Too Well,” and “All You Had To Do Was Stay.” Notably, this is the first of those songs to be about the beginning of a relationship.
“Delicate” topped Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone’s  Top 25 Songs of 2017 list.

Taylor explained a bit about what the word “fearless” means to her in the album booklet:
To me, ‘fearless’ is not the absence of fear. It’s not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you’ve been hurt before. […] No matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and Prince Charmings and happily ever after. That’s why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless.",Fearless

The song was inspired by her recent break up with Joe Jonas. She described it as a song about a relationship with a man who she could feel was “slowly slipping away.”
It’s about watching somebody fade away in a relationship. They said they were going to be with you forever, that they loved you, and then something changed in the relationship and you don’t know what it is, but you’re watching them slowly drift. That emotion of rejection, for me, usually starts out sad and then gets mad. This song starts with this pretty melody that’s easy to sing along with, then in the end I’m basically screaming it because I’m so mad. I’m really proud of that.
The song talks about holding on to every moment with him, since things won’t last.
On the Platinum Editon of the album, the song was redone with a softer piano melody.

You're gorgeous","“Gorgeous” describes a fully intoxicating infatuation in the form of seemingly unrequited love. The man in Taylor’s attention is so impossibly attractive, she feels compelled to be with him even though she already has a boyfriend. The song seems to play with the rumors that Taylor cheated on Calvin Harris with Tom Hiddleston in 2016. Furthermore, the chorus seems to mock the perception that most of Taylor’s discography is comprised of lighthearted, simple songs about boys.
As the third song released from reputation, it was first teased on October 19, 2017, when Taylor posted a short snippet of the track on Instagram. She also hosted a secret album listening party at her home in Rhode Island for a handpicked selection of fans the night before. Some of these fans, along with those who attended the London Secret Session the week before, took to social media to express their love for the song.
Fans have speculated the song is about Taylor’s rumored boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn. During the Rhode Island secret session, she told fans that this song and all the other positive love songs on the album are about him. Although they are not allowed to say much until the album comes out, she wanted her fans to clarify this in online discussions. She also liked multiple posts on Tumblr about this subject as further confirmation.",Gorgeous

Taylor contacted him and he agreed to produce the song. As a result, “Holy Ground” sounds different from any of Taylor’s previous work.
In the song, Taylor is looking back at a whirl wind relationship from her past. She’s realizing just because the relationship didn’t last, doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good memory or that it was wasted time. The memories are still important and sacred. Just because Taylor and the guy weren’t meant to be, doesn’t mean she can’t look back fondly at the time they spent together. Every mistake is a lesson learned.
The song’s hidden message is “When you came to the show in SD” which leads to assumption that this song was penned about Joe Jonas who was spotted at Taylor’s San Diego show during the Speak Now tour

“I Almost Do'” is a song I wrote about the conflict that you feel when you want to take someone back, and you want to give it another try, but you know you can’t. And you can’t because you know it’s hurt you so deeply that you know that you couldn’t bear to go through that again. So you’re sitting there and wondering where they are and hope that they think about you and that you’re almost picking up the phone call, but you just can’t. I think I needed to write this song in order to not call that person actually. I think that writing the song was what I did instead of picking up the phone.
The same relationship she wrote this song about left her so emotional that she suffered six months of writing block prior to being able to begin writing Red, as she mentioned to USA Today.
There’s a kind of bad that gets so overpowering you can’t even write about it. When you feel pain that is so far past dysfunctional, that leaves you with so many emotions that you can’t filter them down to simple emotions to write about. That’s when you know you really need to get out.
The hidden message written in the album for “I Almost Do” reads, “Wrote this instead of calling.”",I Almost Do

The song works as an advice to a guy who wants to get a girl back. She suggests better tactics than the ones her former lovers seemed to have used on her, described in songs like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”.
The song has also been rumored to be about the on/off relationship between Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez.",How You Get The Girl

The song is performed as a duet between music sensations ZAYN and Taylor Swift. Swift also co-wrote the song with producers Jack Antonoff and Sam Dew.
The track is Taylor Swift’s first release in 2016 besides singles from her fifth album 1989. Meanwhile, it’s one of many for ZAYN, who dropped his debut album Mind of Mine in March of that year.
Swift first revealed the track on her social media accounts, debuting the single art and a clip from the song on Instagram. Zayn later posted a photo on Instagram with Swift under the caption “#IDontWannaLiveForever.”

Sounded like footsteps on my stairs

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out

But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'

That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you

With its sound playing between electropop and dubstep, this song marks the significant period in which Swift began to move further away from her country roots and into more pop influences. TIME congratulated Swift on being “the first major artist to fuse country and dubstep.”
It was originally released on October 9, 2012 as the third promo single from Red, and later as an official single on November 27, 2012.
The song was an international commercial success, charting as a top ten hit in more than a dozen countries. In the U.S., it debuted at number three, mainly due to digital sales of 416,000. Later, it peaked at number two, becoming one of her many top-two hits including “You Belong with Me” and “Today Was a Fairytale.”. As of 2019, the song has sold 5.42 million copies in the United States.
The hidden message for the track is “When you saw me dancing”, which leads to speculation that the song is about Harry Styles — whom Taylor is said to have first met backstage at the 2012 Kids Choice Awards.
Her and Selena Gomez were seen dancing to One Direction’s performance of “What Makes You Beautiful”.

The song is about Taylor and her best friend Abigail Anderson. It speaks volumes of how they know each other so well and feel free to be themselves when they are together. The video features Abigail and other of Swift’s friends and family. It has a laid-back setting and shows a more family oriented side of her.

Light up when you smile","The thirteenth track on Taylor Swift’s eponymous debut album  finds her lamenting on someone who doesn’t even notice her.
People have theorized that the song is about Drew Hardwick, the person who inspired “Teardrops On My Guitar,” where she also conveys a similar feeling of longing for a boy she likes as she talks about not being able to sleep at night because of him.
It has never been confirmed, but in an email exchange about her summer days at Jersey Shore, she said that she was inspired to write this song as she looked back on one of the summers she spent there.
She frequented the Shore until she was about fourteen years old, which was also the same age she was when she was in love with Drew. (It was her freshman year in high school at the time). If this song was inspired by her last summer at the shore, which would’ve been right after her freshman year, the dates would line up perfectly to further indicate that this song is about Drew.
The song is also comparable to “You Belong With Me,” in that in both songs the boy is dating a girl who isn’t as good for him as Taylor would be.",Invisible

It’s also worth noting the confidence Swift exudes in the second verse and pre-chorus — this song follows “The Archer,” a vulnerable track about her insecurities in a relationship.",I Think He Knows

I wish you would","This is a song about an ex-lover who she doesn’t exactly think she will never ever get back together with. Although their relationship is over, she has no bitter feelings towards him. A part of her wishes he would try to get back with her, as she would not decline. It also flirts with the idea of a friends with benefits relationship.
A fan who attended the 1989 Secret Sessions held by Queen T herself posted the following story on Tumblr:
Taylor said that she wrote “I Wish You Would” a couple of months after her and Harry [Styles of One Direction] broke up, and they decided to become friends again and she said this was the first time she had become friends with an ex to the point where they were comfortable enough to talk about why the relationship didn’t work out. She said he told her about how, after they broke up, he bought a house literally one road adjacent to hers. Every day he would drive home, and accidentally turn into her street, and he told her how he just wanted to stop at her house and see her, but he never did. She said this song is about while he was in the car making the decision to get out the car and see her, she was sitting in her bedroom, wishing he would make the move and go back to her and just pitch up at her house. She compared it to a classic John Hughes movie where both parties want the same thing but neither has the guts to say anything. Honestly, she spoke so fondly of that relationship. She really does miss it.

“King of My Heart” was first teased on October 26th, 2017, during Swift’s music video for her single “…Ready For It?”, where its song title was hinted at by a red graffiti crowned heart, which was in the background on a wall.

Taylor also makes other references to kingdoms throughout reputation, in songs like “Look What You Made Me Do” and “Call It What You Want.” However, the kingdom in which she refers to in “King Of My Heart” is definitely a more intimate, just between her and her lover, personal, and special.",King of My Heart

After thinking over their relationship, she realizes that there isn’t anything to dislike about him, and just wants to be with him.

The secret message for this song is “forever and always” which is a callback to a song penned about her break-up with Joe. While “Forever & Always” highlights the angry, confused emotions she felt when he left her, “Last Kiss” highlights the sort of melancholy, nostalgic sadness that follows; the gloomy calm after the storm. She reflects on their relationship together, and how in those moments she never thought it would end.
The song has a 27 second intro, which could possibly reflect the 27 second break up phone call she had with Joe Jonas.

Karma's a relaxing thought","On “Karma,” Taylor confronts people from her past,  warning them about the consequences of their actions. Considering the way they acted towards her previously, Taylor is relieved that karma will do her justice and may not be so kind with them.
Karma, as a concept, has been a recurring theme throughout Taylor’s life and discography, especially surrounding her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian in 2016. It was also referenced in several songs on several albums, including “my tears ricochet” from folklore, “Look What You Made Me Do” from reputation, “Bad Blood” from 1989, “All Too Well (Taylor’s version)” and “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s version)” from Red (Taylor’s version).
On the importance of karma in her life, Taylor mentioned it being the most important life lesson to be learned. One more interesting point to note is her reference to karma on her “The Man’s” music video, with a note saying “If found, return to Taylor Swift,” which sparked many rumors about a mystery album Taylor made called Karma. This secret album could be the reason she laughed when announcing the track’s title (Among so many other rumors).
The song’s mixture of drums, guitar and synth create a declaratory atmosphere, allowing Taylor to list all the ways fate will take its course. As a way of indicating its importance for her, she repeats the word karma throughout the chorus. She also repeatedly gives it different forms, showing the ways it can come back to serve fate.",Karma

I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world [Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you [Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered","“Long Live” is the last track on the standard version of Taylor’s 2010 album, Speak Now. In the song, Taylor finds herself looking back at her fondest memories of her career, none of which would be possible without her fanbase and band, who the song is dedicated to.
The secret message for this song in the CD’s lyric booklet is “For You.”

Inspired by a line from a Mad Men episode, Swift wrote this song to convey the desire to focus on the passion of love rather than being swayed by the negative or unwanted remarks of others.
On an October 2022 Instagram post Swift compares her 6-year relationship at the time with british actor Joe Alwyn to the themes of the song, stating:
I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just ‘public figures’, because we live in the era of social media. If the world finds out that you’re in love with somebody, they’re going to weigh in on it. Like my relationship, for six years we’ve had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff, and we just ignore it.
The track was unveiled in Taylor’s TikTok game show, Midnight Mayhem With Me.",Lavender Haze

Having mostly escaped the public eye during her relationship with Alwyn, Swift finally shares some of the most memorable experiences she’s enjoyed.
This track is notable for using an interpolation of the rhythm on Cautious Clay’s “Cold War,” making Clay only the second artist ever to be interpolated on one of Swift’s songs (after Right Said Fred on “Look What You Made Me Do”).",London Boy

The interviewer described the song as a “romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget.” Swift announced the song’s release date during an acceptance speech at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards. Three days later, the song appeared on iTunes, revealing that it’s the third track on the album.
The song is a romantic track dedicated to Swift’s partner of three years, Joe Alwyn. It takes a wedding-like perspective on their relationship and shares information about their romance. A Twitter user who attended one of the secret sessions alleged that “‘Lover’ is Taylor’s favorite [original] song of all time,” having asked her directly during a Q&A.
On the day of its release, “Lover” reached number #1 on the US iTunes charts, making it her 35th song to do so. With this milestone, she extends her record as the female with the most #1 singles in iTunes' history.
The music video for the song was released on August 22, 2019, immediately following Swift’s Lover’s Lounge on YouTube. It features Swift and her love interest in a house inside a snow globe, illustrating the ups and downs of a relationship in progress. During Swift’s livestream, she further revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her 1989 song, “You Are In Love”:
And so it goes

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you","Taylor was inspired to write “Love Story” when she was going through a difficult situation with a boy she liked, whom she wasn’t “officially” dating. The song has been rumored to be about two singers – the first being Joe Jonas, since it was recorded in March of 2008, just a few months before she began actually dating him. Other songs such as “Forever & Always” and “Last Kiss” are more explicitly about him.
The second rumored subject of the song is Boys Like Girls front-man, Martin Johnson whom Swift had a brief fling with in 2008 and collaborated with to pen the band’s track “Two is Better Than One” and Taylor’s song “If This Was a Movie”. This is a fitting match for the “star-crossed lovers” theme of the song as sources claimed that although the pair were into each other, Taylor’s publicists felt he was not a good match for her “American sweetheart” image – with him being a punk rocker who was going through personal issues at the time.
She chose to portray the story of Romeo and Juliet in the song, because she felt like she could relate.
I used to be in high school where you see [a boyfriend] every day. Then I was in a situation where it wasn’t so easy for me, and I wrote this song because I could relate to the whole Romeo and Juliet thing.
The lyrics talk about disapproval against the relationship, and her desire to go somewhere far away with him, and escape the people who look down on them.
“Love Story” peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs, and at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, just weeks after its release.

The song’s music video was described as timeless, by Swift.
‘Love Story’’s plot was a timeless scenario: I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008
The video won the CMT Music Awards for “Video of the Year,” as well as “Female Video of the Year.”

In February 2021, “Love Story” became the first official re-release from Taylor’s backcatalog following contractual disputes with Scooter Braun. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in her career as she sought autonomy and freedom from what she perceived as a manipulative business relationship.",Love Story

Swift released the song as a single in March 2011, and its accompanying music video was directed by Declan Whitebloom, who also directed the music video for “Ours.” The video includes cameos from actress Joey King and singer-songwriter Presley Cash, who both play people experiencing bullying.
The song received positive reviews from outlets like Entertainment Weekly, and won two Grammy awards — Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.",Mean

Once she admits this to her lover, he just smiles because he already knew that something like that was in her nature.
All’s well that ends well to end up with you.
The title is also a nod to her fans calling Swift a “mastermind” for her careful planning of Easter eggs and releases.",Mastermind

It’s a stark turn from her sixth studio album, reputation, released in 2017, which is known for its dark visuals and mature themes.
After a YouTube credits leak the day before its release, the collaboration was confirmed by Swift herself when she appeared with Robin Roberts on ABC. Before Swift went on air, a Spotify billboard in London, England began to promote the track.
The music video for the song gained 65.2 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest 24-hour debut for a female or solo artist on the platform, as well as breaking the record for the biggest 24-hour VEVO debut, which she previously achieved with “Look What You Made Me Do.” It also broke the record for most first-day plays on US pop radio, another record previously held by “LWYMMD.”
Contradicting her own pattern, this is the first cover of one of Taylor’s lead singles to not feature a picture of herself.",ME!

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Ah-oh-oh
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
When everything was slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel

It inspired the name of Swift’s January 2020 documentary Miss Americana, which detailed how revelations in her personal life pushed her to speak her mind more often.
Like “ME!” and “The Man,” this song was produced by Joel Little. It’s the darkest-sounding song he worked on for the album, and it’s reminiscent of Lorde’s 2013 album Pure Heroine, which he also produced.",Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince

She wrote the song when she was in her late teens, but during one of her performances, she dedicated it to the baby of one of her dear friends, model Jamie King, after she made Taylor the godmother.
I wrote it when I was like 18 or 19, but my friend just had a baby and she made me godmother of it and I was holding this little baby the other night, and I was just thinking differently. When you’re holding onto something that’s so innocent and so perfect and has no idea what’s coming for it with the world. The world is going to throw so many things at you as we grow up.

The music is unlike any other Taylor song with the chords played in a unique way starting and stopping (sometimes with vocal effects added over). Taylor gives fascinating insight into her thoughts on want, desire, passion, lust, danger, and fear. What Taylor needs most is to be with the man she loves. It’s essential, like breathing for her. The music is stripped down during the bridge. A really good song that would have fit well on the album and perhaps been a fan favorite.

Written by Swift in her teens, the song was co-written with one of her early collaborators, Robert Ellis Orall, who also co-wrote with Swift and Angelo Petragalia on the album track from her eponymous debut album, “A Place In This World”.
The song is about moving on from someone who couldn’t reciprocate the love, patience and respect you have invested in the relationship despite this person trying to win you back again by connecting with your common friends and personally paying you a visit to your house.
“Need You Now” is another one of those ironic Taylor Swift song titles such as “Forever & Always”, from the 2010 GRAMMY Album of the Year awardee, “Fearless”, as the song depicts someone confronting an ex-partner and declaring that they actually no longer need them and their broken promises and neglect of the relationship.
Fans have noticed the song’s similarities to Swift’s acclaimed album track, “All Too Well”, from her fourth studio album, “RED”.",Need You Now

Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free","“New Romantics” is a satirical song discussing how “new romantics” view love and life. It addresses the nonchalant and whimsical nature of the way young adults approach love. Notably, Taylor doesn’t segregate herself from these young adults. Her constant use of personal pronouns such as “we” and “I” indicate that she has also embraced this mindset.
In past albums, Taylor approached love from very extreme stances namely:

Extremely idealistically i.e. “Love Story”

A bitter or angry reponse to breakups i.e “Picture to Burn”

An extremely heartbroken, torn apart stance i.e. “Dear John”


However, this album introduces Taylor’s new mindset and approach towards love. We see her transition through a breakup and making the discovery that love is not a fairytale, and the chances of a happy ending is very unlikely – so it’s better to live life freely and not take relationships too seriously. Notably, the album begins with “Welcome to New York,” which marks the beginning of her transition, and this song, as the last track on the deluxe edition, indicates how she will be heading into the future – free falling.

Taylor recognizes that when the ‘parties’ in her life are over and the ‘new year’ begins, such memories are all she will have left to hold on to and learn from. She relates a lasting love to someone who shares a midnight kiss with you on New Year’s, but who still stays with you the next morning for the aftermath of the party and begins the new year together with you.
Musically, the song is reminiscent of Taylor’s older tracks, with sparse production and simply guitar and piano as backing. Contrasting many prior songs on the album where Taylor takes shots at various people, she creates a more mature image here–thankful for her past and ready to ‘clean up’ and move on in the future.",New Year’s Day

According to Variety, Swift wrote the song following the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans won most votes. This was the first election where Swift broke her infamous political silence — she publicly endorsed two Democrats in a post on Tumblr and Instagram before Election Day.
The song debuted at #1 on the US iTunes chart, making it Swift’s 38th song to do this, and extending her record as the artist with the most #1s in US iTunes history.",Only The Young

It was included on Taylor Swift due to its popularity with her classmates. However, Swift herself never assumed it would even be on an album.
Taylor talked to The Boot about the story behind the song:
I wrote this song in my freshman year of high school, for my ninth grade talent show. So I was sitting there thinking, “I’ve gotta write a song that’s gonna relate to everyone in the talent show, and it’s gotta be upbeat.” And at that time, I was dating a guy, and we didn’t have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one, and I played it at the talent show at the end of the year.
The uptempo track is musically driven mainly by banjo and lyrically describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song.

Ronan’s mother, Maya Thompson, who gets credit as a co-writer on the song, wrote about Ronan’s journey and the progression of his illness on a blog called Rockstar Ronan, which she now uses to write letters to Ronan about her life and his siblings.
Little did Maya know, Swift stumbled on the blog around the time Ronan died. She  invited Maya backstage at her 2011 Speak Now Tour and they exchanged contact information. Shortly after, Swift told Maya she wrote “Ronan” as a tribute to her son and wanted to perform the song at a 2011 awareness fundraiser for Stand Up To Cancer. Maya recalled the phone call in a 2012 blog post:
‘I wrote a song for Ronan,’ [Taylor] said. The tears started pouring down my cheeks as soon as I heard her say those words. But her words didn’t stop there. Not only did she write a song for you, but she wanted to know if it would be alright to perform it on the nationally televised Stand Up 2 Cancer show which is on every major network and is seen in over 100 countries. She wanted to know if she could use a picture of you in the background while she sang the song. She wanted to make me co-author of the song with her. She talked about how reading this blog and following our story has inspired her, and how amazing she thinks I am and all I am doing to bring awareness to childhood cancer.
Swift has only performed “Ronan” a few times in her whole career, once on the Stand Up to Cancer telethon and a second time when the Thompson family went to her 1989 Tour in 2015. After meeting with the Thompson family, Swift asked if she could perform “Ronan” in his honor that night, and Maya wrote about the evening on her blog. Maya mentioned that she felt Ronan’s presence during the song, which she usually couldn’t listen to without sobbing.
Notably, Swift’s mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, shortly before she performed “Ronan” at the 1989 Tour — her battle inspired Swift’s raw 2019 song “Soon You’ll Get Better.”
After Big Machine Records sold Swift’s masters to mogul Scooter Braun in 2019, Maya expressed her fear and disappointment about Braun owning “Ronan” in two tweets. In July 2021, Maya announced on her blog that Swift rerecorded “Ronan” for Red (Taylor’s Version), allowing them to regain control of Ronan’s story.
All proceeds from “Ronan” went to charities that help fund cancer research, including the Thompson family’s own foundation they founded in Ronan’s name.",Ronan

The haunting song was written by Swift and features the duo The Civil Wars with their signature intricate harmonies.

Ahead of its release, Swift explained the meaning behind “Snow On the Beach” on Instagram, and also expressed feeling “grateful for life” to get to collaborate for the first time with Del Rey, whom she called “one of the best musical artists ever” and admitted being a “massive fan” of hers, although not the first the time, since Taylor had already voiced her admiration for Lana’s work in the past.
“Snow on the Beach” was the final Midnights track to be announced on Midnights Mayhem with Me. Swift revealed the title of the song, and Lana Del Rey being featured on it, during the final episode of her TikTok series.
Rumors of the duo’s highly-anticipated collaboration first sparked in April 2022, after Lana Del Rey shared a picture of her next to Swift and producer Jack Antonoff, a mutual collaborator of both singers, presumed to be the link between them working together.
Upon “Snow On the Beach”’s release, Swift received criticism from fans and the media for continuing to relegate female artists featured in her songs, and not meeting the expectations of a duet with Del Rey, one of the biggest female artists of 2022.
As a consequence, a new version of the song was released on Taylor’s Til Dawn album reedition issued in May 2023, with one of the verses sung by Lana instead.",Snow On The Beach

The line “so it goes” originates from the novel Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, written in 1969. He says the line several times in the novel whenever a death occurs, as a narrative transition to another subject.

This could be symbolic to Swift’s reputation album as a whole, since she has publicly said the “old Taylor” is dead. This album is her transition into the “new” Taylor – so it goes.
Taylor’s use of the phrase could also mean something similar to “That’s life; life goes on.” Even when they “break down a little,” she and her boyfriend are still secure in their relationship and they still keep trying.",So It Goes...

Swift previously spoke about her mother’s illness in a March 2019 piece for Elle Magazine, calling it a “real problem” she needs to prioritize.
During her Lover’s Lounge livestream the night before Lover’s release, Swift admitted this was the hardest song on the album for her to write, as well as explaining that her family discussed whether she should put it on the record. She later told Billboard she wasn’t sure whether she would ever play it live, though she ultimately did to help Global Citizen raise money for COVID-19 relief in April 2020.
This is the second song Swift has written for her mother — her 2008 song “The Best Day” describes their relationship through Swift’s childhood and teenage years. Both “The Best Day” and “Soon You’ll Get Better” are the twelfth tracks on their respective albums.
On a September 2019 interview, with BBC Radio 1, Swift revealed that she decided to include The Chicks on the track because they were her mother’s favorite band and were one of her inspirations to start a career in country music.",Soon You’ll Get Better

You’re my Achilles heel

Unless you play it good and right","“State of Grace” was released as the fourth and final promotional single from Red, and was the only promotional single that wasn’t re-issued as an official single.
Lyrically, the song serves as a warning for what love can be – both amazing and devastating. Essentially it can go both ways, depending on how we go about it.
Throughout the song, we see Swift detailing the beginning of a love with all its possibilities, as well an utterly romantic sentiment and charm about the uncertainty and expectations that come along with any new beginning.",State of Grace

Swift talked a little bit about the meaning behind this song.
After hearing my songs, a lot of people ask me, “How many boyfriends have you had?‘” And I always tell them that more of my songs come from observation than actual experience. In other words, you don’t have to date someone to write a song about them. This is a song I wrote about a guy I never dated! Wow, right? This song is about a guy I thought was cute, and never really talked to him much. But something about him inspired this song, just watching him.",Stay Beautiful

Starlight is a song I wrote actually after seeing a picture of um, Ethel and Bobby Kennedy when they were seventeen. I saw this picture about a year a half ago, and I didn’t know anything about like, what they were doing or what was going on in the picture, but I just thought ‘They look like they’re having the best night.’ And, um, and so I wrote this song about what the night might’ve been like. And um, I ended up meeting Ethel and going and playing it for her and she just loved it. It was such a fun moment when she was just in love with the song and so happy about it and um, it’s just this adorable picture that to me, it just like brought forth all these potentials for how that night could’ve been.

It is about Taylor’s celebrity crush, and how much she is infatuated with him. Although she knows that she’s just another fan of his and that he’ll probably never notice her, she still dreams about him feeling the same way about her, as she does about him.
It is speculated that this song was written about country music star, Jake Owen, whom Taylor opened for in 2006.

Combat, I'm ready for combat","“The Archer” is a mid-tempo track about Swift’s insecurities in a relationship. It’s the third song released from 2019’s Lover, preceded by “ME!” and “You Need To Calm Down.”
Swift first teased “The Archer” in the music video for “ME!,” which features a scene with a band of Cupid-esque angels—Cupid is often depicted as an archer, who shoots arrows at people to make them fall in love. Swift later teased it more directly in the music video for “You Need To Calm Down,” when Hayley Kiyoko shot an arrow into a target with a 5 on it.
“The Archer” follows what Swift’s fans deem the “Track #5 Theory,” which surmises that some of Swift’s most vulnerable, emotional tracks are the fifth track on their respective albums.
There’s also a potential connection with the song’s title and Swift’s zodiac sign. Born on December 13, 1989, Swift is a Sagittarius; otherwise known as the archer sign.",The Archer

Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it [Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover

All throughout the Great War

Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair

The relationship has been very on and off and as “We Are Never Getting Back Together” says in a funny, mocking way, this song sincerely and rawly states – this is the last time. Swift has finally had enough of this relationship, the uncertainty, and the hurt.
In the hidden message of this track in the album cover Swift wrote: “LA on Break”. This seems to hint that this person may have broken up with her while he was in LA on his break. Perhaps in Hollywood on a break from acting. This may be pointing at Taylor’s ex, actor Jake Gyllenhaal. The pair broke up after he did not pitch to her birthday, as he was in LA to promote his movie Love and Other Drugs. This was detailed in her track “The Moment I Knew.”",The Last Time

Swift reportedly wrote this song in Australia, and although she doesn’t say who the song is about (she set a rule against this herself), the song is rumored to be about Joni Mitchell and Kim Wilde, the lyrics: “They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere, chose the rose garden over Madison Square.” could possibly be referencing how Wilde left her career to become a landscape gardener. The main melody is also sampled from Wilde’s “Four Letter Word”
The song ends with Taylor understanding why the star chose that path, and how Taylor feels that she’s becoming the “The Lucky One”.",The Lucky One

Taylor explains:

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she talked about this song:
It’s about what I was going through at the time. I was a complete outcast at school and never fit in, never felt like I belonged. A lot of times back then when I was 12 or 13, I would write songs about relationships, when I wasn’t in relationships, because I would look at other people and try to observe what they were going through. But in the case of ”The Outside,” I was writing exactly what I saw. I was writing from pain. And I’ve always felt so lucky, because I’ve never needed an escape like drinking or drugs or anything like that to escape from the bad days. Music has always been that escape for me.",The Outside

The end","Swift wrote “The Story of Us” after an awkward encounter with ex John Mayer at the 2010 CMT Music Awards, where both parties tried to ignore each other’s presence. She told USA Today that she came up with the song concept after returning home from the event, after telling her mom she felt like she was “standing alone in a crowded room” throughout the evening.
Swift released the song as the fourth single from Speak Now in April 2011, and the music video came out the next month. Swift recruited Noble Jones to direct the video, which they filmed in the library at Vanderbilt University.
The hidden message for this song was “CMT Awards” in the album booklet, leading fans to speculate that the subject of this song is ex John Mayer, who attended the 2010 awards show.",The Story Of Us

During the Secret Sessions held before the release of reputation, Taylor told fans that this song drew on her experiences with fame and the media. She stated that she’d throw extravagant parties and invite her friends on stage with her during the 1989 tour as a nice gesture, to share her success with those around her. However, the media eventually turned that against her, questioning and criticizing her need for a “squad” which led her to essentially move out of the public eye completely and go on a sabbatical for the next year.
Many have also speculated that this song specifically references her ongoing feud with rapper, Kanye West.",This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things

Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s bad, but regardless, it’s still love. It also explores on the idea of fate — a quite common thread throughout Swift’s whole discography —: If a relationship is not supposed to happen at this point in time, you have to let the other person go, even if you don’t want to, and if it’s meant to be, they’ll eventually come back to your life.
Following the release of 1989, Swift told Yahoo! that she considers “This Love” to be the first song in which she really experimented with different vocal recording styles. She goes on to explore more of that side of music in her following album: 2017’s reputation.
As documented by a Tumblr user, this was the first song Swift have written to 1989, right after she dropped her 2012 album Red, and started out with the chorus as a short poem written in her book.
Additionally, despite having writing credits in all of the songs in the album, “This Love” is the only one she wrote all by herself.",This Love

I wrote [“Tied Together with a Smile”] about one of my friends, who is this beauty queen, pageant princess — a gorgeous, popular girl in high school. Every guy wanted to be with her, every girl wanted to be her. I wrote that song the day I found out she had an eating disorder. There are a couple songs on the album like that, that are just watching other people and making observations. But most of the songs on the album are about actual people that have been in my life. I tend to be kind of blatantly obvious, and with my songs, I’ll even mention names a lot of times.
Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder in which sufferers binge eat then get rid of the food by making themselves throw up or other methods of purging. The disorder can disrupt homeostasis and harm the digestive system. Only 6% of sufferers seek help, despite the possible health consequences.

At the time, she was dating a senior named Drew Dunlap and believed they would break up before he left for college, so she wrote this song hoping to memorialize their time together.
The Tim McGraw song in question was 2004’s “Can’t Tell Me Nothin'.” Taylor got to perform the song for a crowd Tim was in at the 2007 ACMs. The two later collaborated on Tim’s 2013 track “Highway Don’t Care.”
In 2018 Taylor also performed “Tim McGraw” live with Faith Hill and TimMcGraw himself during the Nashville leg of her reputation tour!

The song contains strong sensual undertones and while at no point references directly anything explicitly sexual, some of the lyrics can nonetheless be interpreted as a metaphor for sex. Looking at the song through this lens, it can be seen as Taylor realizing that this relationship is moving extremely fast and might be unhealthy.
There are various rumored subjects of the song including John Mayer and Jake Gyllenhaal. The secret message for “Treacherous” featured in the Red album booklet is “won’t stop ‘til it’s over”, a lyric featured on The Temper Trap song – “Sweet Disposition.”. This song is referenced on “All Too Well” – another song thought to be about Jake.
However, the song is most likely about Harry Styles. Taylor confirmed to USA Today that “Treacherous” and “I Knew You Were Trouble” are about the same person, and hints in “I Knew You Were Trouble” point to Harry being the inspiration.
The biggest hint however lies in the songs hidden clue. The hidden message – “won’t stop ‘til it’s over” – is from the track “Sweet Disposition”. This song also contains the lyrics:
Won’t stop to surrender
Harry had a rendition of this tattooed on his arm in April 2012, around the time he was dating Taylor

Taylor admitted to mocking Harry on his erroneous tattoo and The Temper Trap even recounted in an interview of a time Taylor ran into them:
She was like “Hey”, you know, “I’m a big fan” blah, blah, blah. And she goes “Ah, it’s my boyfriend’s birthday soon I wanna give him a present – here’s a piece of paper, can you please write down the lyrics to ""Sweet Disposition”, sign it, I wanna give it to him. So I had this dilemma in my mind at that point – do I write the wrong lyrics? Do I write the right lyrics? I kept it real, I wrote the right lyrics man… And they broke up soon after.
This seemed to be Harry’s favorite track at the time he dated Taylor (around April 2012) as he tweeted lyrics to the song on multiple occasions.

The pair also collaborated to pen the track “You’ll Always Find Your Way Back Home” for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie.
This song performed well on charts, even reaching number 18 on the Canadian Billboard Hot 100.
The song laments on the singer’s realization that he needs a particular person in his life despite his previous doubts. This reflective, sombre piece is a love story at heart like many of the other tracks on Love Drunk, but takes a more vulnerable and delicate approach than many of the band’s more uptempo, rock songs.
Interestingly, Taylor and Martin are also rumored to have had a brief relationship at the time the song was written.",Two Is Better Than One

Welcome to New York, welcome to New York","The opening track for 1989 introduced the world to a brand new Taylor Swift. After experimenting with electronic pop elements on Red, her country starlet persona was all but gone with the release of 1989.
The title is a literal way for Taylor to welcome fans to her new sound. Paralleling her own move from Nashville to New York, 1989 as an album reflects her new lifestyle—moving from her country roots to the big city with all its glitz and glamour. She told Rolling Stone in September 2014:
I really like my life right now…I love the album I made. I love that I moved to New York. So in terms of being happy, I’ve never been closer to that.
Taylor teased the lyrics on Instagram on October 14, 2014, and it premiered on October 20 to everyone who pre-ordered the album.
As proof of her love for her adopted hometown, all proceeds from sales of the single went to New York City Public Schools. The city also showed love back when they made Taylor a tourism ambassador.
Despite all this, the song had mixed reviews, even being called “the worst NYC anthem of all time.”

The themes of this song heavily parallels Swift 2020’s track “no body, no crime”, which also sees her involved in vigilantism.
Musically, this song continues with heavy synths reverberating, never quite building to its climax. The sultry, building tune creates a dreamy atmosphere similar to that of “Dress” or “Call It What You Want”, but the subject matter is considerably darker.",Vigilante Shit

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now [Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Starin' at the sunset, babe

In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha","The ninth track and fifth single on 1989 is about Swift hoping her lover will remember their best moments after they’re over. It expresses mixed feelings: hoping that they last, but knowing that they’ll end.
Surprisingly, the famous figure who gets the most elaborate attention is Lana Del Rey: Swift flat-out mimics her on “Wildest Dreams,” flitting between a fluttery soprano and deadpan alto, flipping lyrics so Lana — “His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room” — that it’s hard to tell if the song is homage or parody.
-Billboard Magazine
In the US, the song reached number five, becoming her fifth consecutive top ten from 1989.

According to Swift, the beats heard at the beginning of the song resemble her real heartbeats.",Wildest Dreams

Flashing lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us ""Don't rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)

All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin'
And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh

In Wonderland","“Wonderland” is a bonus track from the Deluxe Edition of 1989. It is a description of a toxic relationship, from beginning to end. It uses the story of Alice In Wonderland as inspiration for the highs and lows of enjoying this state of relationship wanderlust, irrespective of negative consequences.
Taylor posted this lyric teaser on her Instagram in December 2014:
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had. And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad.
Interestingly, Taylor also did a photoshoot with fashion magazine Wonderland in November 2014, with many fans surprised by her different look.

One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love [Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
[Breakdown]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)

You are in love","Taylor Swift told Jimmy Kimmel:
It’s a song I wrote that is loosely based on… I wrote it with my friend Jack Antonoff (of Fun. and Bleachers) who’s dating my friend Lena [Dunham]. Jack sent me this song, it was just an instrumental track he was working on and immediately I knew the song it needed to be. And I wrote it as a kind of commentary on what their relationship has been like. So it’s actually me looking and going and ‘this happened and that happened then that happened’ and that’s how you knew, “You are in love”.




This song along with “Wonderland” and “New Romantics” are only available in the deluxe version of 1989, which was exclusively sold at Target.",You Are In Love

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

Taylor said the following about the track on a page on Big Machine Records' website, which has since been removed:
I had overheard a friend of mine talking to his girlfriend and he was completely on the defensive, saying [things like] ‘I love you more than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry.’ She was just yelling at him! I felt so bad for him at that moment. So I came up with the first line ‘you’re on the phone with your girlfriend, she’s upset, she’s going off about something that you said,’ and I ran that into the storyline that I’m in love with him and he should be with me instead of her.",You Belong With Me

You need to calm down","“You Need To Calm Down” finds Taylor Swift addressing various detractors who post hurtful comments online, following themes of self-love and being true to one’s identity which previously appeared on “ME!” from April 2019. Her second collaboration with producer Joel Little, it’s also the second single from her seventh studio album, Lover.
In the second verse, Swift continues to show her support for the LGBTQ+ community, following a June 2019 letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, as well as a petition she created to fight for legal equality among all people, regardless of sexuality or gender. It’s also significant to note that Swift released the song in June, which is recognized as Pride Month.
A music video for the song was released on June 17, 2019 after its official premiere on Good Morning America. It features cameos from several LGBT celebrities, including Hayley Kiyoko, Laverne Cox, the cast of Queer Eye, and Todrick Hall, who co-executive produced the video. At the end of the video, Katy Perry appears in the midst of a food fight, signifying the end of her “feud” with Swift.
Swift teased the lyric and title “You Need To Calm Down” in the April 2019 music video for “ME!.” In the beginning of the video, Swift argues with featured artist Brendon Urie, and he tells her that she needs to calm down.",You Need To Calm Down

Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance

On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?

Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've

I regret you all the time","In “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve”, Taylor uses morbid and religious overtones in order to express regret for a youthful relationship that left her deeply scarred. This draws on themes such as those in previous songs “A Perfectly Good Heart” and “Dear John”, where the singer’s naivete was similarly trampled on.
“Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” draws on Taylor’s relationship with John Mayer, which took place when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. The age difference was highly criticized at the time, but the young Taylor stuck to her rebellious guns. Now, with more than a decade of experience accumulated since the end of the relationship, Taylor now regrets it, given its power imbalance, the untimely taking of her innocence, and the lasting trauma she maintains from it. She laments that she was enabled to leap too quickly into things she should have taken her time with.
The song itself is filled with heavy, threatening drums that provide a rock feel, juxtaposed with vocal background harmonies reminiscent of religious choirs. This combines to create an ominous track with sobering associations. Sonically, there is a somewhat comparable feel to Taylor’s earlier songs “Haunted” and “Don’t Blame Me”, albeit with a much different message.","Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve"

You always have been","“You’re On Your Own, Kid” recounts a young person who longs for love but eventually understands that they are on their own as the song progresses toward its conclusion. The verses take you through her younger life and the music builds as she matures through the song.
As the song builds into a frenzy, the audience receive a glimpse into Taylor’s past life: she writes a song, burns the lyrics or letters into ashes. Suddenly, she’s on her own, figuring out how to be herself.
The song utilizes a soft-pulsing percussive beat that slowly blossoms into an alt-pop soundscape. Lyrically and vocally, it sounds like something from Red, but with a darker sheen.
The song parallels Lover’s “It’s Nice To Have a Friend”, also about school kids falling in love. Musically, both have similar, short rhyming couplets.","You’re On Your Own, Kid"
