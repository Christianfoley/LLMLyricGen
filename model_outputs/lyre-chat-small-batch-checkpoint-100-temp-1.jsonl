past\nAppearing to you in a cloud of smoke\nWith a six-shooter in my hand\nAnd a switchblade in my sock\nI'm like the Ranger, protecting the park\nWhile you're visiting from the city\nWith a spear in my hand and a sniper rifle, perched on a hill\nI'm just a 10-year-old kid from Lincoln Park\nBut I'll take on all of you motherfuckers at once\nWith half of my talent, I could take on Slim Shady\nAnd
