    "model_response":"It was a dark and stormy night, the kind of night that makes you wish you were indoors with a good book and a hot toddy. The kind of night that makes you grateful for the inventions of central heating and the drug aspirin.\nI was walking up the steps to my apartment building when I felt a sudden chill, the kind of chill that makes you shiver and think of things you'd rather not think about. I reached in my pocket for my key, and that was when I heard the voice.\n\"Hey, kid,\" it said.\nI turned and looked around, but there was nobody there. Then I heard it again, only this time it was closer.\n\"Hey, kid,\" it said, and I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and saw a face that I will never forget. It was the face of a man who had seen better days, a man who had been around the block a time or two.\n\"Yeah?\" I said.\n\"Who are you?\" he said.\n\"I'm the guy who's going to kick the shit out of you if you don't mind,\" I said, and started to turn away.\n\"Hey, kid,\" he said again, and I felt the hand on my shoulder press a little harder.\n\"What do you want?\" I said.\n\"I want to talk to you,\" he said, and I could hear the alcohol in his voice.\n\"I'm in a hurry,\" I said.\n\"So am I,\" he said, and I felt the hand on my shoulder pull me around. When I turned, I saw that he was standing with his foot on the first step of the steps leading up to my apartment building.\n\"What do you want?\" I said again.\n\"I want to talk to you,\" he said, and I could see the glint of something metallic in his hand.\n\"What is it?\" I said.\n\"It's a gift,\" he said, and threw something at me. I ducked, and when I looked up again, he was starting up the steps.\n\"Hey,\" I said, and started to run after him.\n\"Hey, kid,\" he called back, and I could hear him laughing as he disappeared into the night.\nI ran up the steps and into my apartment, slamming the door behind me and leaning against it to make sure it was locked. Then I looked down at what he had thrown at me and my heart began to pound. It was a small, white, unmarked pill, and I knew at once that it was a drug of some kind. I picked it up and turned it over in my hand, wondering what it could be. It was about the size and shape of a bar of soap, and it had a funny smell. I put it in my pocket and called the police.\nTen minutes later, they arrived, and I showed them the pill. They took it and sent it to the laboratory, and a few days later, I received a phone call from a detective at the police station.\n\"What did you tell us the man's name was?\" he asked.\n\"He didn't give me his name,\" I said.\n\"Well, we've identified the pill,\" he said. \"It was a new drug, one that we haven't seen before. We're not sure what it does.\"\n\"What do you mean you haven't seen it before?\" I said.\n\"It was a new drug,\" he said again.\n\"But who is he?\" I said.\n\"We don't know,\" the detective said. \"All we know is that he's been using this drug on other people. We're looking for him.\"\n\"Do you think he'll try to find me again?\" I said.\n\"We can't guarantee that he won't,\" the detective said. \"But we'll do everything we can to protect you.\"\n\"What can I do?\" I said.\n\"Stay where you are,\" he said. \"We'll find him.\"\nI hung up the phone and went to bed, and I never slept better in my life. I knew that I would never see that man again, and I was right.\nThe next morning, I got a call from the laboratory. They had finished their analysis of the pill, and they had some news.\n\"What did it do?\" I said.\n\"It's a sex hormone,\" the doctor said. \"It's a very powerful one. In fact, it's so powerful that it could cause serious side effects in some people.\"\n\"What",
    "target_response":"Playboy: All right, let's start with the most basic question there is: Are you a religious man? Do you believe in God?\nSinatra: Well, that'll do for openers. I think I can sum up my religious feelings in a couple of paragraphs. First: I believe in you and me. I'm like \nAlbert Schweitzer\n and \nBertrand Russell\n and \nAlbert Einstein\n in that I have a respect for life -- in any form. I believe in nature, in the birds, the sea, the sky, in everything I can see or that there is real evidence for. If these things are what you mean by God, then I believe in God. But I don't believe in a personal God to whom I look for comfort or for a natural on the next roll of the dice. I'm not unmindful of man's seeming need for faith; I'm for anything that gets you through the night, be it prayer, tranquilizers or a \nbottle of Jack Daniel's\n. But to me religion is a deeply personal thing in which man and God go it alone together, without the witch doctor in the middle. The witch doctor tries to convince us that we have to ask God for help, to spell out to him what we need, even to bribe him with prayer or cash on the line. Well, I believe that God knows what each of us wants and needs. It's not necessary for us to make it to church on Sunday to reach Him. You can find Him anyplace. And if that sounds heretical, my source is pretty good: Matthew, Five to Seven, The Sermon on the Mount.\nPlayboy: You haven't found any answers for yourself in organized religion?\nSinatra: There are things about organized religion which I resent. Christ is revered as the Prince of Peace, but more blood has been shed in His name than any other figure in history. You show me one step forward in the name of religion and I'll show you a hundred retrogressions. Remember, they were men of God who destroyed the educational treasures at Alexandria, who perpetrated the Inquisition in Spain, \nwho burned the witches at Salem\n. Over 25,000 organized religions flourish on this planet, but the followers of each think all the others are miserably misguided and probably evil as well. In India they worship white cows, monkeys and a dip in the Ganges. The Moslems accept slavery and prepare for Allah, who promises wine and revirginated women. And witch doctors aren't just in Africa. If you look in the L.A. papers of a Sunday morning, you'll see the local variety advertising their wares like suits with two pairs of pants.\nPlayboy: Hasn't religious faith just as often served as a civilizing influence?\nSinatra: \nRemember that leering, cursing lynch mob in Little Rock reviling a meek, innocent little 12-year-old Negro girl as she tried to enroll in public school?\n  Weren't they -- or most of them -- devout churchgoers? I detest the two-faced who pretend liberality but are practiced bigots in their own mean little spheres. \nI didn't tell my daughter whom to marry, but I'd have broken her back if she had had big eyes for a bigot.\n As I see it, man is a product of his conditioning, and the social forces which mold his morality and conduct -- including racial prejudice -- are influenced more by material things like food and economic necessities than by the fear and awe and bigotry generated by the high priests of commercialized superstition. Now don't get me wrong. I'm for decency -- period. I'm for anything and everything that bodes love and consideration for my fellow man. But when lip service to some mysterious deity permits bestiality on Wednesday and absolution on Sunday -- cash me out.\nPlayboy: But aren't such spiritual hypocrites in a minority? Aren't most Americans fairly consistent in their conduct within the precepts of religious doctrine?\nSinatra: I've got no quarrel with men of decency at any level. But I can't believe that decency stems only from religion. And I can't help wondering how many public figures make avowals of religious faith to maintain an aura of respectability. Our civilization, such as it is, was shaped by religion, and the men who aspire to public office anyplace in the free world must make obeisance to God or risk immediate opprobrium. Our press accurately reflects the religious nature of our society, but you'll notice that it also carries the articles and advertisements of astrology and hokey Elmer Gantry revivalists. We in America pride ourselves on freedom of the press, but every day I see, and so do you, this kind of dishonesty and distortion not only in this area but in reporting -- about guys like me, for instance, which is of minor importance except to me; but also in reporting world news. How can a free people make decisions without facts? If the press reports world news as they report about me, we're in trouble.\nPlayboy: Are you saying that . . .\nSinatra: No, wait, let me finish. Have you thought of the chance I'm taking by speaking out this way? Can you imagine the deluge of crank letters, curses, threats and obscenities I'll receive after these remarks gain general circulation? Worse, the boycott of my records, my films, maybe a picket line at my opening at the Sands. Why? Because I've dared to say that love and decency are not necessarily concomitants of religious fervor.\nPlayboy: If you think you're stepping over the line, offending your public or perhaps risking economic suicide, shall we cut this off now, erase the tape and start over along more antiseptic lines?\nSinatra: No, let's let it run. I've thought this way for years, ached to say these things. Whom have I harmed by what I've said? What moral defection have I suggested? No, I don't want to chicken out now. Come on, pal, the clock's running.\nPlayboy: Hasn't religious faith just as often served as a civilizing influence?

I've thought this way for years, ached to say these things. Whom have I harmed by what I've said? What moral defection have I suggested? No, I don't want to chicken out now. Come on, pal, the clock's running.\nPlayboy: All right, then, let's move on to another delicate subject: disarmament. How do you feel about the necessity and possibility of achieving it?\nSinatra: Well, that's like apple pie and mother -- how can you be against it? After all, despite the universal and unanimous assumption that both powers -- Russia and the United States -- already have stockpiled more nuclear weaponry than is necessary to vaporize the entire planet, each power continues to build, improve and enlarge its terrifying arsenal. For the first time in history, man has developed the means with which to expunge all life in one shuddering instant. And, brother, no one gets a pass, no one hides from this one. But the question is not so much whether disarmament is desirable or even whether it can be achieved, but whether -- if we were able to achieve it -- we would be better off, or perhaps infinitely worse off.\nPlayboy: Are you suggesting that disarmament might be detrimental to peace?\nSinatra: Yes, in a certain very delicate sense. Look, I'm a realist, or at least I fancy myself one. Just as I believe that religion doesn't always work, so do I feel that disarmament may be completely beyond man's capacity to live with. Let's forget for a moment the complex problems we might face in converting from a cold war to a peace economy. Let's examine disarmament in terms of man's political, social and philosophical conditioning. Let's say that somehow the UN is able to achieve a disarmament program acceptable to all nations. Let's imagine, a few years from now, total global disarmament. But imagine as well the gnawing doubts, suspicions and nerve-wracking tensions which must, inevitably, begin to fill the void: the fear that the other side -- or perhaps some third power -- is secretly arming or still holding a few bombs with which to surprise and overcome the other. But I firmly believe that nuclear war is absolutely impossible. I don't think anyone in the world wants a nuclear war -- not even the Russians. They and we and the nth countries -- as nuclear strategists refer to future nuclear powers -- face the incontrovertible certainty of lethal retaliation for any nuclear strike. I can 't believe for a moment that the idiot exists in any nation that will push the first button -- not even accidentally.\nPlayboy: You foresee no possibility of world war or of effective disarmament?\nSinatra: I'm not an industrialist or an economist; I know I'm way out of my depth when I attempt even to comprehend the complexity of shifting the production of a country from war to peace. But if somehow all those involved in production of implements of destruction were willing to accept reason as well as reasonable profit, I think that a shift in psychology might be possible. And if this were to happen, I believe that the deep-seated terror in the hearts of most people due to the constant threat of total destruction would disappear. The result would be a more positive, less greedy, less selfish and more loving approach to survival. I can tell you this much from personal experience and observation: Hate solves no problems. It only creates them. But listen, you've been asking me a lot of questions, so let me ask you a question I posed to \nMike Romanoff\n the other night. You know, Mike is quite a serious thinker; when we spend an evening together, we play an intellectual chess game touching on all topics, including those we are discussing here. Anyway, I asked Mike what would happen if a summit meeting of all the leaders in every country in the world was called, including Red China, at the UN. Further suppose that each leader brings with him his top aides: Kennedy brings Rusk, Khrushchev brings Gromyko, Mao brings Chou. All these cats are together in one room, then -- boom! Somebody blows up the mother building. No more leaders. No more deputies. The question I asked Mike, and the one I ask you, is: What would happen to the world? Playboy: You tell us.\nSinatra: I told Mike I thought it might be the only chance the world has for survival. But Mike just shook his head and said, \"Frank, you're very sick.\" Maybe so. Until someone lights the fuse, however, I think that continuation of cold war preparedness might be more effective to maintain the peace than the dewy-eyed notion of total disarmament. I also wonder if \"total\" disarmament includes chemical and bacteriological weapons -- which, as you know, can be ju st as lethal as nuclear weapons. Card players have a saying: \"It's all right to play if you keep your eyes on the deck\" -- which is another way of saying, \"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\"\nPlayboy: Do you feel, then, that nuclear testing should be continued?\nSinatra: Absolutely not. I think it's got to stop, and I think it will stop -- because it has to stop. The name-calling in the UN and the finger-pointing at peace conferences is just a lot of diplomatic bull. Both sides have to live on this planet, and leaders in all countries know that their children and grandchildren have to live here, too. I suspect that when the limits of strontium 90 in the atmosphere get really dangerous, scientists in both camps will persuade the politicians to call a final halt to testing -- probably at precisely the same time, with no urging from the other side.\nPlayboy: You spoke a moment ago of the fear and suspicion that might nullify any plan for lasting and effective disarmament. Isn't continuing nuclear preparedness -- with or without further testing -- likely to engender these emotions on an even more dangerous scale?\nSinatra: Fear is the enemy of logic. There is no more debilitating, crushing, self-defeating, sickening thing in the world -- to an individual or to a nation. If we continue to fear the Russians, and if they continue to fear us, then we're both in big trouble. Neither side will be able to make logical, reasoned decisions. I think, however, that their fear and concern over the ideological balance of power in some areas is far from irrational. Our concern over a Sovietized Cuba 90 miles from Key West, for instance, must be equated with Russian concern over our missile bases surrounding them. It is proper that we should be deeply concerned, but we must be able to see their side of the coin -- and not let this concern turn into fear on either side.\nPlayboy: On a practical level, how would you combat Communist expansion into areas such as Cuba, Laos and the emerging African nations?\nSinatra: It strikes me as being so ridiculously simple: Stop worrying about communism; just get rid of the conditions that nurture it. Sidestepping Marxian philosophy and dialectical vagaries, I think that communism can fester only wherever and whenever it is encouraged to breed -- not just by the Communists themselves, but by depressed social and economic conditions: and we can always count on the Communists to exploit those conditions. Poverty is probably the greatest asset the Communists have. Wherever it exists, anyplace in the world, you have a potential Communist breeding ground. It figures that if a man is frustrated in a material sense, his family hungry, he suffers, he broods and he becomes susceptible to the blandishments of any ideology that promises to take him off the hook.\nPlayboy: Do you share with the American Right Wing an equal concern about the susceptibility of our own country to Communist designs?\nSinatra: Well, if you're talking about that poor, beaten, dehumanized, discriminated-against guy in some blighted Tobacco Road down in the South, he's certainly in the market for offers of self-improvement. But you can't make me believe that a machinist in Detroit, ending a 40-hour week, climbing into his '63 Chevy, driving to a steak barbecue behind his $25,000 home in a tree-lined subdivision, about to begin a weekend with his well-fed, well-clothed family, is going to trade what he's got for a Party card. In America -- except for tiny pockets of privation which still persist -- Khrushchev has as much chance of succeeding as he has of making 100 straight passes at the crap table.\nPlayboy: In combating Communist expansion into underdeveloped areas here and abroad, what can we do except to offer massive material aid and guidance of the kind we've been providing since the end of World War II?\nSinatra: I don't know. I'm no economist. I don't pretend to have much background in political science. But this much I know: Attending rallies sponsored by 110-percent anti-Communist cultists or donning white sheets and riding with the Klan -- \nthe one that's spelled with a \"K\"\n -- isn't the answer. All I know is that a nation with our standard of living, with our Social Security system, TVA, farm parity, health plans and unemployment insurance can afford to address itself to the cancers of starvation, substandard housing, educational voids and second-class citizenship that still exist in many backsliding areas of our own country. When we've cleaned up these blemishes, then we can go out with a clean conscience to see where else in the world we can help. Hunger is inexcusable in a world where grain rots in silos and butter turns rancid while being held for favorable commodity indices.\nPlayboy: Is American support of the UN one of the ways in which we can uplift global economic conditions? Sinatra: It seems to me that a lot of us consider the UN a private club -- ours, of course -- with gentlemen's agreements just like any other exclusive club. Only instead of excluding a person, a race or a religion, the members of the UN have the power to exclude entire nations. I don't happen to think you can kick 800,000,000 Chinese under the rug and simply pretend that they don't exist. Because they do. If the UN is to be truly representative, then it must accept all the nations of the world. If it doesn't represent the united nations of the world, then what the hell have you got? Not democracy -- and certainly not world government. Everybody seems to have forgotten that President Kennedy, before he became President, in his book, Strategy of Peace, plainly advocated recognition of Red China. So I'm not too far out on the limb, am I?\nPlayboy: With or without mainland China in the UN, what do you feel are the prospects for an eventual American rapprochement with Russia?\nSinatra: I'm a singer, not a prophet or a diplomat. Ask the experts or read the Rockefeller brothers' reports. But speaking just as a layman, an ordinary guy who thinks and worries, I think that if we can stay out of war for the next 10 years, we'll never have another war. From all I've read and seen recently, I'm betting that within the next decade the Russians will be on the credit- card kick just as we are. They're going to want color TV, their wives are going to want electrified kitchens, their kids are going to want hot rods. Even Russian girls are getting hip; I've seen photos of them at Russian beach resorts, and it looks just like the Riviera. They're thinning down, and I see they're going the bikini route. When GUM department store in Moscow starts selling bikinis, we've got a fighting chance, because that means the girls are interested in being girls and the boys are going to stop thinking about communes and begin thinking connubially. I've always had a theory that whenever guys and gals start swinging, they begin to lose interest in conquering the world. They just want a comfortable pad and stereo and wheels, and their thoughts turn to the good things of life -- not to war. They loosen up, they live and they're more apt to let live. Dig?\nPlayboy: We dig.\nSinatra: You know, I'd love to visit Russia, and sometime later, China, too. I figure the more I know about them and the more they know about me, the better chance we have of living in the same world in peace. I don't intend to go there with a mission, to sell the American way of life: I'm not equipped to get into that kind of discussion about government. But I'd love to go and show them American music. I'd take Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald with me and we'd do what we do best. We'd wail up a storm with real American jazz so that their kids could see what kind of music our kids go for, because I'm sure that kids are the same all over the world. I'm betting that they'd dig us. And that's got to create some kind of good will, and man, a little good will is something we could use right now. All it takes is good will and a smile to breach that language barrier. When the Moiseyev Dancers were in Los Angeles. Eddie and Liz Fisher gave a party for them, and although I couldn't speak a word of Russian, I got along fine. I just said, \"Hello, baby\" to the dancers and they shouted, \"Allo, babee\" back at me. We had a ball.\nPlayboy: Frank, you've expressed some negative views on human nature in the course of this conversation. Yet one gets the impression that -- despite the bigotry, hypocrisy, stupidity, cruelty and fear you've talked about -- you feel there are still some grounds for hope about the destiny of homo sapiens. Is that right?\nSinatra: Absolutely. I'm never cynical, never without optimism about the future. The history of mankind proves that at some point the people have their innings, and I think we're about to come up to bat now. I think we can make it if we live and let live. And love one another -- I mean really love. If you don't know the guy on the other side of the world, love him anyway because he's just like you. He has the same dreams, the same hopes and fears. It's one world, pal. We're all neighbors. But didn't somebody once go up onto a mountain long ago and say the same thing to the world?"

In the second verse, he sings about a hurricane destroying everything in its path and its aftermath. The hurricane is likely a reference to Hurricane Katrina, which hit Louisiana while Ocean was a student at the University of New Orleans, forcing him to relocate to Houston. It\u2019s possible this person died during Katrina.\nAs sung in the song\u2019s opening lines, the track\u2019s title is a reference to a sunset drive with Frank and his old friend. \u201cPink and white\u201d describes the sky during the moment he is reminiscing on. Frank has used those colors in songs before\u2014He has a song titled \u201cWhite\u201d in Odd Future\u2019s The OF Tape Vol. 2 and a song called \u201cPink Matter\u201d on Channel ORANGE.\nFrank uses simple syllabic structure in this verse to keep the back and forth assonance of wordplay working and keep his lines short and understood with a lot of meaning behind each word he uses. He\u2019s describing a situation, an experience he once had, while using as few words as possible to maintain the mood of the song itself.\nPrior to the release of his debut album, channel ORANGE, Ocean was credited as a writer on Beyonce\u2019s \u201cI Miss You.\u201d Queen B and Frank have also collaborated on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s track, \u201cSuperpower.\u201d\nPharrell seemingly confirmed producing this song with an Instagram post.

The mansion is known as \u201cHoliday House.\u201d\nTaylor draws subtle comparisons between herself and Rebekah Harkness in the song. She likens her star-studded parties to the bevy of famous composers and and dancers that once frequented Holiday house in Harkness' days.  Also similar to Taylor Swift, Rebekah Harkness was often a target of harsh criticism from the tabloids, and people alike.\nThis song is reminiscent of \u201cThe Lucky One\u201d from her album Red where Taylor Swift sang of an unnamed Hollywood star who moved away from the limelight and from under the microscope of the media, into a life of solitude.\nThe style of the song follows Taylor Swift\u2019s familiar contemporary pop sound.

Jackson stepped outside of his R&B box and created a rock track highlighted by a guitar solo courtesy of Eddie Van Halen, which he provided free of charge after initially thinking the request was a prank.\nProducer Quincy Jones suggested Jackson should write a song like The Knack\u2019s 1979 hit \u201cMy Sharona\u201d and Michael explained his mentality in creating \u201cBeat It\u201d:\nI wanted to write a song, the type of song that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song. That is how I approached it and I wanted the kids to really enjoy it\u2014the school kids as well as the college kids.\n\u201cBeat It\u201d is a song about the dichotomy of wanting to prove your toughness through fighting but also knowing when to have the strength to back down from a fight. This was highlighted by the popular music video, which Jackson paid $150,000 out of his own pocket to produce after Epic Records refused to finance it. Written and directed by Bob Giraldi, the video was shot in the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles and featured real gang members from the Crips and Bloods preparing to rumble before breaking out into one of the most popular choreographed dance routines in music video history. It premiered on MTV on March 31, 1983 and went on to win several awards, including two American Music Awards and seven Billboard Video Awards.\n\u201cBeat It\u201d was an international hit, topping the pop charts and achieving multi-platinum status in multiple countries, as well as winning Grammy Awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and Record of the Year. Rolling Stone magazine ranked \u201cBeat It\u201d #185 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and the song was included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u2019s list of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.

It was originally titled \u201cIn Other Words,\u201d and was introduced by Felicia Sanders in cabarets. The song became known popularly as \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d from the first line of the B verse, and after a few years the publishers changed the title to that officially.\nFrank Sinatra recorded the best known version on the album It Might as Well Be Swing (1964), accompanied by Count Basie. This version was arranged by Quincy Jones who changed the time signature from \u00be waltz-time to 4\/4 and gave it a looser, swing feel.

It followed the release of \u201cWildest Dreams (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d making it the second song on 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) to see the light of day.\nThis track finds Taylor using cyclical metaphors to ponder on the cycles of a relationship. Sometimes it\u2019s good, sometimes it\u2019s bad, but regardless, it\u2019s still love. It also explores on the idea of fate \u2014 a quite common thread throughout Swift\u2019s whole discography \u2014: If a relationship is not supposed to happen at this point in time, you have to let the other person go, even if you don\u2019t want to, and if it\u2019s meant to be, they\u2019ll eventually come back to your life.\nFollowing the release of 1989 in 2014, Swift told Yahoo! that she considers \u201cThis Love\u201d to be the first song in which she really experimented with different vocal recording styles. She goes on to explore more of that side of music throughout 2017\u2019s reputation.\nAdditionally, as documented by a Tumblr user, this was the first song Swift have written to 1989, right after she dropped her 2012 album Red, and started out with the chorus as a short poem written in her book. Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

The track was released as the fourth single from her seventh studio album Unapologetic on April 3, 2013, peaking at #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart during March of that year.\nCo-producer Luney Tunez discussed the track\u2019s creation during an interview with Complex:\nthat was one of the beats I really don\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t one of my favorites.

In addition to the simple fusion of sounds, he also uses repetition multiple times throughout the song, most notably in his second verse, augmenting the agony and regret he\u2019s going through. One interesting point to note is Austin\u2019s use of piano, which is a rare occurrence on his songs (and hopefully a recurrent one). Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

The song\u2019s heart-warming lyrics are part of a light and dreamy track that compliment the duo\u2019s heavenly vocals.\nAhead of its release, Swift explained the meaning behind \u201cSnow On the Beach\u201d on Instagram, and also expressed feeling \u201cgrateful for life\u201d to get to collaborate for the first time with Del Rey, whom she called \u201cone of the best musical artists ever\u201d and admitted being a \u201cmassive fan\u201d of hers, although not the first the time, since Taylor had already voiced her admiration for Lana\u2019s work in the past.\n\u201cSnow on the Beach\u201d was the final Midnights track to be announced on Midnights Mayhem with Me. Swift revealed the title of the song, and Lana Del Rey being featured on it, during the final episode of her TikTok series.\nRumors of the duo\u2019s highly-anticipated collaboration first sparked in April 2022, after Lana Del Rey shared a picture of her next to Swift and producer Jack Antonoff, a mutual collaborator of both singers, presumed to be the link between them working together.\nUpon \u201cSnow On the Beach\u201d\u2019s release, Swift received criticism from fans and the media for continuing to relegate female artists featured in her songs, and not meeting the expectations of a duet with Del Rey, one of the biggest female artists of 2022.\nAs a consequence, a new version of the song was released on Taylor\u2019s Til Dawn album reedition issued in May 2023, with one of the verses sung by Lana instead.

    "prompt":"Write me a song called Time Waits For No One with the following description: Kenny Loggins' 1979 album Feel the Fire contains the song \u201cWho\u2019s Right, Who\u2019s Wrong\u201d, which features background vocals by Richard Page and a twenty-year-old Michael Jackson. Melodically, the openings of the verses to \u201cWho\u2019s Right, Who\u2019s Wrong\u201d and \u201cTime Waits For No One\u201d (1980) are nearly identical, and the fact that the songs begin in the same key and have a similar tempo makes the correlation even more apparent.\nAlthough the Triumph album notes list \u201cTime Waits for No One\u201d as being written by Jackie and Randy Jackson, the extent to which Michael Jackson influenced the composition of the song, or was influenced by some of the background vocal gigs he took during this period, remains unknown.\nWhat can easily be argued, however, is that as a ballad, \u201cTime Waits for No One\u201d feels much more like the largely soft-rock-like material in Michael Jackson\u2019s background work for Loggins, Carole Bayer Sager, and Dave Mason, than like the Jacksons' more Philly-influenced earlier ballads (i.e. \u201cGood Times\u201d, \u201cFind Me A Girl\u201d, and \u201cPush Me Away\u201d).\nEven if Michael Jackson did not really believe in genre differentiation, as he stated in a 1980 interview, the soft-rock influence in \u201cTime Waits for No One\u201d adds interest to the period between Off the Wall and Thriller, since he did not venture into this kind of musical territory before or after.

    "prompt":"Write me a song called XXX. with the following description: Kendrick teams up with rock legends U2 on \u201cXXX.,\u201d which delves deeper into the political and religious themes heard throughout DAMN. In an August 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Kendrick described how this song came together:\nWe had a [different] record we were supposed to be doing together. He sent it over, I laid some ideas to it, and we didn\u2019t know where it was going. I just happened to have an album coming out, so I just asked [Bono], \u2018Yo, would you do me this honor of letting me use this record, use this idea that I want to put together because I\u2019m hearing a certain type of 808, a certain drum to it.\u2019 And he was open to it.\nThe track itself seems to be a transitional moment on the album. Going with the original album play-through or the backwards play theory, in his path of wickedness, Kendrick begins to question the hypocritical ways of America after setting aside his Godly ways and overcoming fear. However, on his path to weakness, Kendrick continues on after \u201cLOVE.,\u201d where he expresses his feeling towards his significant other, and, on this track, Kendrick expresses what he would do to protect his woman as well as his immediate family, before giving his life to God.\nIn the first verse, Kendrick begins by addressing moral ambiguity, noting that even the best of us are capable of evil if the conditions are right. Kendrick brags about his accomplishments on the streets before a friend calls him for advice on the devastating death of his son\u2014the usually-meditative Kendrick pushes him to take violent revenge. The second verse provides the worldly context for this violence, continuing the nihilistic themes found on \u201cPRIDE.\u201d\nIn an excellent piece of criticism, Steven Hyden notes that the lyrics of \u201cXXX.\u201d grapple with spiritual dislocation in America, with Old Testament overtones\u2014something U2 has been doing for three decades.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Nardwuar the Human Serviette unintentionally predicted this collaboration back in March of 2012, before good kid, m.A.A.d. city\u2019s release, when he interviewed Kendrick at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. Watch his response when asked if he would ever like to have a sleepover with Bono:\n\n\n\nYouTuber Justin Hunte goes into depth in this video about \u201cXXX.\u201d and how Kendrick is representing his generation. He breaks down how the last verse of the song calls out America for its hyprocrisy in these lines:\nYou overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us\nGang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera\nAmerica\u2019s reflections of me, that\u2019s what a mirror does Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

The song features production from Sool Got Hits and multi-platinum producer Murda Beatz, who has several production credits across the album.\nThe song was first previewed in an Instagram post made by 6ix9ine on October 28, 2018. Prior to 6ix9ine revealing the album\u2019s official tracklist, both Nicki and Kanye\u2019s presence on the song was confirmed by Don Canon during an Instagram live stream, in which he played the song and cut it off after Nicki\u2019s first bar.\nDuring the filming of the music video on November 9, 2018, a drive-by shooting occurred, bringing the video shoot to a halt and ultimately causing the video to be scrapped.\nAfter the album\u2019s release, 6ix9ine unexpectedly got in legal trouble with Fashion Nova as he was paid US$100,000 to rap about the popular clothing brand in one of his songs. He had chosen \u201cMAMA,\u201d where the preview originally revealed him rapping:\nSplish, splash, Fashion Nova make that ass fat\nIn the final version of the song, however, he instead raps:\nSplish, splash, Apple Bottoms make that ass fat\nIt is speculated that the change occurred due to Nicki\u2019s refusal to allow a brand promoted by her rival, Cardi B, to be mentioned.

Vocals are handled by frontman Luke Hemmings and lyrically, the track sees the band debate whether or not to stay in a toxic relationship.\nThe band first teased its release by posting a 15-second-snippet of the song on their Twitter. Signifying the track\u2019s dark nature, the snippet was accompanied by visuals of band members chained up, drowning, and in a hall of photos ridden with flames.\nIn an interview with Official Charts, OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, who co-wrote the track, said he was \u201cecstatic\u201d for the song\u2019s release and that\nI\u2019ll put it this way, it has a little Nine Inch Nails in it.\nThe song has a hard rock feel, but with a relatively sparse arrangement. 5 Seconds of Summer told Rolling Stone it came about because there has been \u201ca growing attention to industrial rhythm within the band.\u201d They said that the track is \u201cderivative of the driving drum groove\u201d that\u2019s heard on Nine Inch Nail\u2019s track \u201cCloser.\u201d The band added that they were also inspired by dark, synth-heavy groups such as Depeche Mode and Tears for Fears.

    "prompt":"Write me a song called Slave to the Rhythm with the following description: \u201cSlave to the Rhythm\u201d is off of Michael Jackson\u2019s second posthumous album, Xscape, that was released on May 8, 2014.\nThis song chronicles the story of a woman who faces oppression by men at home and in the workforce. Although originally recorded and penned in 1991 this song\u2019s message is one that is now at the forefront of politics today. Classic example of Michael Jackson being ahead of his time. The infectious rhythm makes the listener feel forced to dance and allows them to empathize with the woman. If the listener listens closely they hear a crowd in the background cheering. The conjunction of this cheering and Michael\u2019s \u201cChop\u201d \u201cChop\u201d ad-libs assist the allegory of an oppressed woman to a dance slave. Another noteworthy observation is how Michael Jackson was an adamant advocate against the corruption in the entertainment industry. Perhaps he is trying to unify celebrities like himself  and non celebrities through their shared oppression of higher occupational forces. This further showcase  understated humanity of celebrities.\n\u201cChop\"\n\nIn 2010, this song was considered for the posthumous album, Michael, but was later scrapped and was not released. The 2010 version had re-worked production by Tricky Steward. That version leaked in December 2010. Years later, a duet remix with Justin Bieber was made, and eventually it leaked in August 2013. Though it was not officially released, the remix received negative feedback from Jackson\u2019s fans. Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

However, not even a snippet of the track would surface until 2017, when Martin Shkreli played a small portion of the song on a live stream, as he owned a copy of the 2014 version of the album.\nThe song was notably absent from the standard release of Tha Carter V on September 28, 2018, but nearly a year later, on September 13, 2019, the track leaked online along with the most of a 2014 CD rip of Tha Carter V. Then, another year after the leak, the song was completely re-recorded, featuring different lyrics to the leaked version, and it later released on Tha Carter V\u2019s deluxe edition. Lil Wayne removed all references to his girlfriend in 2014, Christina Milian, when he released the final version of Tha Carter V in 2018, and she was featured on the outro to the leaked version of \u201cLife Of Mr. Carter,\u201d so it makes sense that Wayne reworked the entire song to remove her for its official release on the deluxe.\nThe final version of the song\u2019s song structure is similar to the leaked version\u2019s song structure except the two verses swapped positions, while the two refrains remained in the same place.

This is why I love Kanye,\u201d that kind of thing. It\u2019s like my wife\u2019s favorite f\u2014ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?\nTaylor:\n Okay.\nKanye:\n \nSo it says, \u201cTo all my Southside n\u2014 that know me best\/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.\u201d [chuckles]\nTaylor:\n [chuckles] That\u2019s not mean.\nKanye:\n Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I\u2019m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it\u2019s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, \u2018Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s super genius to have you be the one that says, \u2018Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it\u2019s like, I got like s\u2014 on my album where I\u2019m like, \u201cI bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain\u2019t love the same bitch.\u201d\nTaylor:\n Oh my [laughs]. I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not mean though. It doesn\u2019t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. \nI thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it\u2019s not.\n Um, so I don\u2019t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I\u2019m asked about, of course I\u2019m gonna be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d but um, I\u2019ll think about it.\nKanye:\n Yeah, you don\u2019t have to do\u2014you don\u2019t have to do the launch and retweet. That\u2019s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that\u2019s cool, then that\u2019s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.\nTaylor:\n You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they\u2019re gonna be like, \u201cWow,\u201d like this thing\u2014like they\u2019ll just turn it into something that \u2026 I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it\u2019ll be less cool \u2018cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, \u2018cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it\u2019s like almost \u2026 I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?\nKanye:\n Yeah.\nTaylor:\n \nI try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I\u2019m like this close to overexposure.\nKanye:\n Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.\nTaylor:\n I know, it\u2019s like a compliment, kind of [laughs].\nKanye:\n I had this line where I said\u2014and my wife really didn\u2019t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, \u201cTo all my Southside n\u2014 that know me best\/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,\u201d and my wife was really not with that one. \nShe was way more into \u201cShe owes you sex,\u201d but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s\u2014 that I was like, \u201cAhhh.\u201d\nTaylor:\n That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m kind of\u2014I mean, they\u2019re both really edgy, but that\u2019s the only thing about that line is that it\u2019s like gonna \u2026 It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don\u2019t give a fuck, so\u2026\nKanye:\n \nYeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make\u2014\nTaylor:\n That\u2019s sweet.\nKanye:\n \u2014you feel good. I don\u2019t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I\u2019m mad at Nike, so people think like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He\u2019s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.\u201d\nTaylor:\n Why are people saying you\u2019re bullying Nike?\nKanye:\n Because on \u201cFacts\u201d I said like, \u201cYeezy, Nike out here bad, they can\u2019t give shit away.\u201d\nTaylor:\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that\u2019s just what you do though.\nKanye:\n [laughs]\nTaylor:\n [laughs] I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s like possible to bully a company like Nike where\u2014I mean, um, yeah, I mean \u2026"

Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn\u2019t think I was gonna make it.\nI remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.\nAfter I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.\nI would walk around my house and thinking every single day, \"I'm gonna fucking die.\" I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them. \nI'm growing. I just couldn\u2019t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something\nThe doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,\nI was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore. It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family, now that I understand that I\u2019m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.\nI wanted to make an overall statement \u2014 \nI\u2019m back\n. It was a slow process. \nYou gotta remember I hadn\u2019t recorded a song sober in seven years\n. \nSo it took me a while to even feel like I could record a song sober \u2026 I don\u2019t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It\u2019s been years.\nI almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s what I\u2019m fully capable of, if there\u2019s one weak line, I wanna change it. Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now rap\u2019s getting me high again.\nSo I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does."

    "prompt":"Write me a song called Mother I Sober with the following description: \u201cMother I Sober\u201d is the eighth track on disc two of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s fifth and final studio album with Top Dawg Entertainment, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, and the seventeenth track overall. It features Beth Gibbons on the Chorus and Sam Dew on the outro, respectively.\nLamar instantly opens up with heartfelt and personal lyrics where he battles his trauma head-on. At the start of the song, Lamar details his upbringing and the trauma associated with it. He details his mother\u2019s experience with sexual abuse and then her fear that Lamar may be experiencing assault as well. Later on, Lamar asserts he was never subject to drug addiction, rather it was lust itself. Lamar then feels a sense of despair and hopelessness as he opens up to cheating on his, at the time, fianc\u00e9. He compares this action in the same vein as his mother\u2019s abuser. He then describes the instantaneous remorse and guilt he has to this day. Shortly after, Lamar broadens his viewpoint on the toxic sex culture faced by the Black community and how it must be brought to attention. He exclaims, however, that sexual abuse many Black children face can be a root cause of this culture as our society doesn\u2019t feel like a safe space. This is what is later coined as the \u201cgenerational curse\u201d Black people face. Towards the end of the song, it is then where Kendrick metaphorically frees himself and everyone affected by the toxicity through the use of transparency, pride, and positivity, thus aiming to break the \u201cgenerational curse\u201d.\nThis all relates to the theme Kendrick is constantly reasserting throughout the project. Kendrick is only human and he too is prone to make mistakes. Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

    "target_response":"Pop music (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of \"popular\") is usually understood to be commercially recorded music, often oriented towards a youth market, usually consisting of relatively short, simple songs utilizing technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. Pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, but as a genre is particularly associated with the rock and roll and later rock style.The phrase \u201cpop music\u201d was first coined around the middle of the 1920\u2032s, it meant a piece of music had \u201cpopular\u201d appeal. Numerous things that took place during the recordings of the 20\u2032s could be seen as being the start of the modern day pop music industry, which includes rhythm and blues music, as well as, country, folk, and others.\nPop music has been a profitable industry in America since the 19th century, but Early Pop\/Rock is a style that took shape in the post-rock & roll era, once the more conservative elements of the record industry had come to terms with the new musical landscape. Popular culture is distributed across many forms of mass communication including newspapers, magazines, radio, television, movies, music, books and cheap novels, comics and cartoons, and advertising. It contrasts with high cultural art forms, such as opera, classical music and artworks, traditional theater and literature. In mass communication, the term popular culture refers to messages that make limited intellectual and aesthetic demands through content that is designed to amuse and entertain audiences.\nMichael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, the seventh of Katherine and Joe Jackson\u2019s nine children. At the age of 5, Jackson began performing with his older brothers in a music group coached by their steelworker father. In 1968, Motown Records signed the group, which became known as the Jackson 5, and Michael Jackson, a natural showman, emerged as the lead singer and star. The Jackson 5\u2019s first album, released in 1969, featured the hit \"I Want You Back,\" and the group\u2019s brand of pop-soul-RnB music made them an immediate success. Their musical popularity even led to their starring in their own TV cartoon series in the early 1970s. Jackson released his first solo album, \"Got to Be There,\" in 1972, while continuing to sing with his brothers. Six years later, in 1978, he made his big-screen debut as the Scarecrow in \"The Wiz,\" an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name. Directed by Quincy Jones, the film starred an all-black cast that included singer Diana Ross as Dorothy. Jones collaborated with Jackson on his 1979 album \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d which sold some 7 million copies worldwide. The pair teamed up again for Jackson\u2019s now-iconic 1982 album, \"Thriller,\" which went on to sell 50 million copies around the globe, making it the best-selling studio album of all time. \"Thriller\" is credited with jump-starting the era of music videos and playing a key role in the rise of then-fledging cable TV network MTV, which launched in 1981.  With his record-breaking album Thriller and such international hit singles as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cBeat It,\u201d Michael Jackson became the quintessential \u201980s pop star. Jackson\u2019s ability to blend r&b with pop, rock guitars with dance beats, combined with his cross-format radio success and innovative videos to create a pop music template that is still with us today."

The song was produced by DJ Khalil, whom Marshall had worked with often on this album.\nIt describes his feelings on many different topics. One of the first topics he touches on is his urge to create songs that specifically target  different rappers who were popular at the time. He named two of them in the song.

Later in the song he says, \u201cAll these other rappers suck is all that I know.\u201d It is unknown if he was including the two rappers previously mentioned.\nIn the second verse he takes the song name literally, and begins to talk to himself. He raps about his struggles with addiction and hatred towards himself for being in the position he was in at the time of his hiatus.\nIn the third and final verse he apologizes to all who had to see him go through his addiction. He even shout outs various rappers who also were going through what he called \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d\nDuring the outro, he is speaking directly to everyone he was going to create songs about and also, of course, his fans.\n Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

    "model_response":"Zane Lowe: \nWelcome back to BBC Radio 1\n. It's great to have you back in the building.\nKanye West: \nGreat to be back\n.\nZL: \nLast time we spoke, we had a great conversation, but it was a difficult one as well. I think people were surprised by some of the things you said.\nKW: \nI was surprised by some of the things I said as well.\nZL: \nBut it was a really honest conversation and I think people respected you for it. But I think what we didn't really get a chance to explore was the music. \nYou'd just released \nYeezus\n and I remember playing that album to bits on the radio.\n Do you remember that?\nKW: \nYeah, I remember that.\nZL: \nAnd I remember the response from our listeners was overwhelmingly positive. But I think what we didn't really get a chance to talk about was how that album came to be and what was going through your mind when you were making it. So I'm glad we've got you back in the building so we can explore that.\nKW: \nYeah, for sure.\nZL: \nSo the last time we spoke, you were on the cusp of releasing \nYeezus\n. \nSince then we've had \nThe Life Of Pablo\n and we're at the end of that journey now.\n But I think there's still a lot of questions about how this album came to be and what was going through your mind. \nSo can you tell me, how did you approach making \nThe Life Of Pablo\n?\nKW: \nWell, you know, \nYeezus\n was very much just me wanting to make something very minimal, very raw. I had just made \nDark Twisted Fantasy\n and \nWatch The Throne\n, and I felt like I had expressed all of the more pop side of my abilities, you know, working with Jay Z and all that. So I just wanted to strip it all the way down and make something that was just very raw and minimal. And \nYeezus\n was made in a very, like, aggressive period of my life, when I was really upset about some things that were going on in my life, some personal things. And so the record was made in a very aggressive time period. \nThe Life Of Pablo\n was made after a period of time where I had really, like, re-evaluated my life and I had met my daughter, and I had gotten to a point where I felt like I had the responsibility to create something that was more...I don't want to say more positive, but just something that was more inspiring and uplifting for people. So the record was made in a very, like, peaceful and happy time period, and the music reflects that.\nZL: \nWell, I mean, you can hear that, right? I mean, there's a lot of joy in that record, but there's also...I mean, you can be inspired and uplifted and still be talking about some heavy topics. I mean, there's some heavy topics on that record.\nKW: \nYeah, for sure.\nZL: \nBut I think what I love about the record is, I think you're right, there is a lot of joy in it, but it's not necessarily what you would expect from a Kanye West album. And I think that's what makes it so interesting.\nKW: \nYeah, for sure.\nZL: \nSo can you tell me, what was it like making that record? What was the process like?\nKW: \nWell, the process was different than any other record I've made.\nZL: \nOh, yeah? How was it different?\nKW: \nWell, I had just gone through this experience of having a baby, and I had also gone through this experience of being in this very aggressive relationship. And I had just kind of...I had hit rock bottom of that relationship, and I was in the hospital, and I had just kind of came to grips with everything. And so the record was made in a very peaceful time period for me. And then on the creative side of things, the record was made very differently than any other record I've made.\nZL: \nOkay, tell me more about that.\nKW: \nWell, the",
    "target_response":"Zane Lowe\n: Nice to see you again man. Thanks for stopping by the BBC for a chat\nKanye West\n:  Good to see you too sir. Thank you\nZane Lowe\n: So, I was thinking today like where do we begin? \nBecause you\u2019ve been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time.\n We were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. The first question I wanted to ask you, cause I\u2019ve always wondered how you felt at that time\nKanye West\n:  I had so many interviews where I\u2019m trying to express that I can create, that I can create outside of just the music box \nand I\u2019m giving examples of work that I did that was really successful and I\u2019m getting just completely shut down.\n \nBut not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like \u201cno, you are celebrity.\n You are not allowed to create, you\u2019re not allowed to think, you\u2019re not allowed to have an opinion. \nYou\u2019re just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.\u201d\n \nAnd it\u2019s true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as I told you last time I said I\u2019m a product guy\nZane Lowe\n: Yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and I mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what\u2019s occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. You know, what\u2019s happened recently with Yeezy supply, you know your deal with Adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they\u2019ve seen -- how has that experience been for you? How can you put that into context for us?\nKanye West\n:  I mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it\u2019s a challenge. You gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019mma word it. You know what I\u2019m saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was flexible enough \nand had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart.\n You know, they original hip hop\nZane Lowe\n: Of course, Run DMC man I mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and I wondered when did the conversation actually begin with Adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry?\nKanye West\n:  That conversation had already started before then. There was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling \nJon Wexler\n you know, it was a certain point where I just felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe anymore like I had all these ideas and I felt like I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone\u2019s creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something. And anyone that\u2019s creative understands that there\u2019s no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create. There\u2019s no check out and there\u2019s no cheque to stop you from creative. No pun intended when I\u2019m saying no check\nZane Lowe\n: Was a good one though\nKanye West\n:  Just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because I mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. I mean I look at over 500 images a day on my laptop. \nAnd I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I said \u201cpeople be dissing me on Hypebeast\u201d\n and it\u2019s like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a long time, \nsince like Universe City.\n Like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. I\u2019mma throw this one out here. I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was working on \nYeezus\n \nand I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.\n And the guy, actually I forgot about the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C. and I was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and I\u2019m sitting with him, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket. And he makes some joke about, you know \u201cYou did look pretty hot. I\u2019m happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.\u201d\nZane Lowe\n: Was he joking do you think?\nKanye West\n:  He was leveling. He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time. Like if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet. You know someone that I know that\u2019s put in a lot of work. And it\u2019s a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. You know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. And I\u2019m just sitting like \u201cWhoa, ok.\u201d Obviously I have to show him like hey I\u2019m working on this stuff and it\u2019s coming out good and this is all I have a chance to work on. \nYou know like when I worked with A.P.C. I only had two times to look at the collection, you know I couldn\u2019t really grab it and dig into it the way I dig into like working on \u201cAll Of The Lights\u201d or something like that, it\u2019s like, there\u2019s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you\u2019re dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently\nZane Lowe\n: I can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you\u2019re leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. Seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. At those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled Kanye West\n: Everyone, everyone I talked to would try to level me. You know. And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of Adidas. And I say \u201cwas\u201d because he passed away recently. \nAnd I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we\u2019ve never shown online because you have to experience it in it\u2019s space.\n It\u2019s the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. And which I got all no\u2019s on that \u2013 to date. And this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed. He believed that maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was. In me he could tell, he knew, he\u2019s like this guy has something to say and to give that\u2019s past the current box that he\u2019s put in. \nAnd he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.\n And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. \nThe deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.\n That is what the deal is about. \nThe deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there\u2019s never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show.\n \nThe deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater,\n and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard \u201cWolves,\" when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasn't about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people.\n I feel like there's so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it.\n And I asked my assistant one time. I was like, \"how does these clothes make you feel?\" She said, \"I feel powerful.\" And that's our, that's our main goal. \nAs the song says, \"no one man should have all that power.\" No \none\n man should have it. Everyone should have it\nZane Lowe\n: You seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that.. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way you're able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. And it feels like you're very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. You know, and across the border. And when that moment kind of occurred to you. Cause that doesn't happen overnight, you know.. there's.. but it does lead up to that. And 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. And now it seems to me like you're very consciously aware\nKanye West\n: Yeah, I was still off, you know what I mean? I might have some things that are off now, but I feel like, in the same way when I came up with \"All Falls Down,\" and I was able to differentiate myself from whoever I was trying to rap like at that point and I found my voice and my message. It's like, I felt like..\nZane Lowe\n: That was the moment you felt like that was, yeah..\nKanye West\n: \nWhen I wrote \"All Falls Down.\" That's when I was like, \"okay, this is who I am in the.. this is what I'm, this is what I'm presenting.\"\n So now I feel like.. it's funny, I would always say, you know, \n\"I wanna sculpt with marble.\"\n And it wasn't until I was working on \nYeezus\n, and I was learning about furniture and the fact that I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for. \nAnd one of the things they had was  this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone. And it was made of cement. So it wasn't the material, it was the idea that was the most important.\n And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use. That I find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. You know, it was a futile argument for me to say, \"hey, everyone, get behind me so I can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford.\" It's like insane. \nBut now I feel people rallying because they know that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I know that Adidas can eventually get those price points.\n \nAnd I want to apologize to everyone right now because I believe that Season 1 may still be in that upper price point\n and there's still the words \"exclusivity,\" you know, being thrown around. \"Exclusivity\" is the new N-word. Not nigga, \"exclusivity.\" Am I saying the word right?\nZane Lowe\n: Yeah\nKanye West\n: Yeah, \nthat\n is the new N-word. Cause nothing should be exclusive.  \nEveryone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain.\n The idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. And saying, \"we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain.\" \nYou know, we have to reboot our mentality. Period. Of a generation. You know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold one sweatshirt. You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. And they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. You know\nZane Lowe\n: Yeah. Because the thing is when people hear you talking at times I think that there's a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, you're compelling to a lot of people. And, you know, what you say is.. I think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. But some people I think have thought overtime  that.. they've obviously missed the point. They've thought that you bringing it back to you. But you're actually trying to open up to everybody else. You're trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know.. If you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. It might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point\nKanye West\n: And I was, I was using the wrong words. My rap was wrong. You know what I'm saying? I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. You know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar. \"Yo, what up, baby? I'm a genius!\" They be like, \"yo, who's this guy?\" \"No, I'm telling you, I sold all this, I sold this many shoes.\" Then she be like, \"yo, chill, chill.\" Like, \"gosh, get me out of here already.\" You know what I'm saying? And that's who I was and that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this.. I'm looking at this girl like, \"man, I know that..\"\nZane Lowe\n: \"We could be good together, this could work.\"\nKanye West\n: Yeah, I know, I just don't know how to work it\nZane Lowe\n: So I'm messing it up, yeah\nKanye West\n: \nAnd the right way so I'm gonna stumble. I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know.. Zane Lowe\n: You're the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations?\nKanye West\n: Yeah. I did not know how to communicate at all. And it's like I had my point, my message was, you know, simply like, \n\"your egg, my semen, we change the world.\"\n You know, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong\nZane Lowe\n: That's a hell of a pick up line, man\nKanye West\n: I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like..\nZane Lowe\n: It's okay, it's okay, wrong..\nKanye West\n: We have the right to be wrong sometimes\nZane Lowe\n: That's a great line. You know I wanted to talk to you.. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, I mean, we talked a couple times before as well. And you know I'm a music guy, I mean, it really drives me, and it's a big part of my life. And over the course of this conversation, you know, I wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause I'm fascinated in the certain things I wanna touch on, but I do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if that's cool. Do you want to talk about music?\nKanye West\n: Yeah\nZane Lowe\n: Cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn't \nreally\n wanna talk about \nYezus\n. You were like, \"that's cool and everything, but I wanna talk about this.\" And lately, I just, maybe I'm, I feel like you're really energized with music in a big way\nKanye West\n: You know, after I did the presentation in New York I \nwas able to get that alien out of my stomach,\n you know like. I was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the \"Blessings\" video with Big Sean and Drake\nZane Lowe\n: Yeah\nKanye West\n: And I couldn't have been happier. To go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. Well, let's be respectful and truthful. \nThe\n hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. And I fall somewhere in that, you know? In that, that field. So..\nZane Lowe\n: Getting back to music for a minute, I feel like we're right back, I gotta bring you right back for a second. I want to know what we can look forward to on this record. \nYou talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents.\n And every record you have made has been something new and fresh. You've taken yourself and your craft to a new place. Where's your head at right now with this new album? Kanye West\n: Just working hard. On it\nZane Lowe\n: And it's fun?\nKanye West\n: And it's fun. And it's fun to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people. That fight, and you know, \nThe College Dropout\n came out of a fight to want to rap. And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design. \nAnd..\nZane Lowe\n: I wondered about that, cause \nYeezus\n was punk-rock to me. That was like, that was Sex Pistols to me. That was like Public Enemy to me. That was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. And I wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. And without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. Where it's coming from\nKanye West\n: I mean, it's a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know\nZane Lowe\n: As opposed to just the struggle?\nKanye West\n: Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible.\n You know I wanna perform \u201cOnly One\u201d \nas\n many times as possible. You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I didn\u2019t come here to be liked I came here to make a difference. I\u2019m not talking about this interview, I\u2019m talking about life. Some people\u2019s job they\u2019re very extremely likeable and I think I could figure that out. I think I\u2019m way nicer to people just in general. Everyone I meet I\u2019m extremely nice. But as soon as people start playing games I stop. I stop playing games. And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one. People be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. But it\u2019s all love, and great energy and positive energy. I like the, I like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I\u2019m sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like \u201cda-da-da-da-da!\u201d and this happened and that happened and he say \u201cYo man, it\u2019s all cool though! How bout we make a song?\u201d And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song\nZane Lowe\n: He is the most, cause I\u2019ve met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. And he so gets it in the sense that it\u2019s like kinda let it lead you. Let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe I get from him like yea, let\u2019s just see where this goes\nKanye West\n: And yea that\u2019s what we did. You know people think that our first two singles don\u2019t have drums but both of those are percussive instruments\nZane Lowe\n: Yea totally that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s like \u201cdun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun\u201d that\u2019s what it is. S I just wanna talk about working with him because I haven\u2019t actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I just, I love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it\u2019s a natural one. Certainly on \u201cFourFiveSeconds\u201d I think that\u2019s one of\n Rihanna\u2019s greatest vocal performances period\nKanye West\n: She was killing that right?\nZane Lowe\n: My gosh man. I mean that\u2019s like a whole other attitude that I haven\u2019t heard from her as a star. She\u2019s really gone inside that record and wrangled it. How was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to, \nit almost has like a 70\u2019s FM American rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what I mean, like something you would\u2019ve heard in Los Angeles in \u201976 or something\nKanye West\n: I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was growing up. And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don\u2019t need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that..\nZane Lowe\n: It\u2019s because he invented them\nKanye West\n: Yea exactly. And be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it\u2019s just like way next to, \nlike meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren\nZane Lowe\n: Yea, totally!\nKanye West\n: It\u2019s like \u201cwhoa!\u201d\nZane Lowe\n: Dude he\u2019s the greatest\nKanye West\n: The greatest of their field, period. Of all time\nZane Lowe\n: And you got to say \u201cwildin\u2019\u201d in a song with him it\u2019s just incredible cause it\u2019s still hip hop, that\u2019s what\u2019s amazing about it\nKanye West\n: Yea the whole cadence was trap. Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trap\nZane Lowe\n: That\u2019s again is the fusion of cultures which I love. It\u2019s what did you call it before when you when you were talking about Sean wearing [Raf?] and your shoes \u2013 you were saying, it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t remember what you said\nKanye West\n: \nFusion is the future. Period. The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know.\n Humanity period man, we\u2019re one people and maybe that\u2019s like \nincorrect English \u2013 I\u2019m sorry mom\n \u2013 but you know I went to Louise Wilson\u2019s memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. And I\u2019m talking about \nof all timers\n.\nZane Lowe\n: Educate us man, tell us\nKanye West\n: \nOk so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever. \nNotorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. So the first time that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's \nC\u00e9line\n collection, I was looking at a 12. When I saw McQueen\u2019s last show the \nAtlantis\n collection, I was looking at a 12. Christopher Kane's \nBandage\n collection I\u2019m looking at a 12. Alber Elbaz I\u2019m looking at a 12. That\u2019s the designer, the designer of\n Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men\u2019s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.\n Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. And she said so many students, they don\u2019t give it their all. And the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they\u2019re 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap\nZane Lowe\n: \n(clapping)\nKanye West\n: \nExactly, that\u2019s what she said, they clap. And she just looked at me, she said \u201cKanye, don\u2019t clap.\u201d\nZane Lowe\n: Aww, what, that\u2019s just! How you getting on with that?\nKanye West\n: \nI didn\u2019t know we were gonna lose her.\n You know I just um, and she told me she said, you know \u201cthank you for the times you know, when we came to performances\u201d and \u201cthis has like really meant a lot to me.\u201d You know she would\u2014\nZane Lowe\n Wanna take a minute? We\u2019ll take a minute. Let\u2019s take a minute\nKanye West\n: That\u2019s never happened to me in an interview before\nZane Lowe\n: You ok?\nKanye West\n: Yea, I\u2019m ok, I think I\u2019m ok\nZane Lowe\n: We\u2019re gonna change the subject. Here we go. One of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you\u2019re gonna be the head of the world\u2019s first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind Kanye was what is that company going to look like?\nKanye West\n: Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion from what I know, Elon Musk included, is like the world\u2019s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design. And I said from what I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I know. He said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I think that, I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a way. So, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn\u2019t be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me driving down the westside highway \u201cthere\u2019s no money in the innovation.\u201d\nZane Lowe\n: Yea, and he\u2019s got a point\nKanye West\n: The money\u2019s in the repetition, you know so..\nZane Lowe\n: It\u2019s in the quality\nKanye West\n: And making something of better quality for more people. So it has to be a balance of both. I\u2019ve said this a few times but I wanna just say it right here for people who haven\u2019t read it or seen but I think people think that I pander to fashion particularly. You know because, people say \u201cwhy fashion?\u201d It\u2019s not politics, world war it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s fashion, it\u2019s \njust\n a jacket or something, it\u2019s \njust\n a dress. But I believe that the world can only be saved through design. And I think that the fashion world has.. and when I say through design, I know it\u2019s some snarky classist editor that\u2019s gonna take that and say \u201cKanye West said that the world will be saved with a couture dress.\u201d That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. The mentality behind design, you know art is to be free. Design is to fix\nZane Lowe\n: This is important, you\u2019re talking about the actual, like you say the mentality, the purpose behind it, what it means behind the actual product\nKanye West\n: No politics, just truth. Does it fucking work or not. Irrigation, you know, that\u2019s a form of design\nZane Lowe\n: What are those conversations like, because you, one of the great privileges that you\u2019re in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves. So that conversations can be pushed. And I wonder what those conversations are like because I\u2019m fascinated by somebody like Elon Musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary. And you are very much cut from that same cloth. What is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or [?] as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that?\nKanye West\n: That\u2019s exactly what we talk about. What does Kanye West and Elon Musk talk about? The fut\u2019\nZane Lowe\n: The fut\u2019 -- TM\nKanye West\n: So when I put out things that if I say hey, I want to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just put it out, you know. We just put it out there. Or as I told Obama last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest that you sit with Elon Musk. I would suggest that both you guys go to China. I would suggest this. The, I think it may happen\nZane Lowe\n: Must be amazing, those conversations man must be amazing\nKanye West\n: I got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it. And I almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I wasn\u2019t going crazy, I was like the only person that \nwasn\u2019t \ncrazy. You know what I\u2019m saying like, I just stand there and I just look like \u201cis anyone else here seeing what I\u2019m seeing? None of you guys are seeing what I\u2019m seeing\u201d or it\u2019s just like your Maybach and your house is like \nthat\n important that you won\u2019t move at all\nZane Lowe\n: It\u2019s distractions\nKanye West\n: That you won\u2019t say anything at all in risk of losing something. You won\u2019t say anything on anyone\u2019s behalf at this point? You know so, if you have that ability to do that, to see that, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to apply it. You have to use it. You can\u2019t be psyched out. You know, everyone\u2019s on our side. I was just in my own way, but everyone\u2019s on our side and everything that I ever said will happen, will happen. Just as much as you guys saw that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you saw that front row. The juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future. It is the glass shattering of the class system, which is the new racism. Class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement. To somehow say that this person right here means more than this person. Like I know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but \nall\n lives matter. Like, my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. He keeps us safe. My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work every day. The guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne. It\u2019s no more of this separation of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty. Whatever it is that people use to separate people\nZane Lowe\n: But was that moment, which I didn\u2019t want to talk about but you raised it and I want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience. You can\u2019t have all those answers straight away, you have to make those mistakes yourself I think in order to come to that level of clarity\nKanye West\n: And I\u2019m not saying I have answers, I\u2019m just saying these are my current opinions. As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions now\nZane Lowe\n: Sure, sure, and that\u2019s great, that\u2019s what we want, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking questions so we get to hear your answers. \nBut when you, I think\u2026\n \nCause you know I was nominated for that Album Of The Year as well as part of the Sam Smith album as a producer and a co-writer\nKanye West\n: Oh, oh wow\nZane Lowe\n: Right, so I was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co-writers that are part of each records. And, like I\u2019m a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and I\u2019m a huge fan of Beck and it\u2019s funny that you say, you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion. But then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old Ye, you know old Yeezy. Is that what happened that night? Just \u201cgaaah, I can\u2019t take it I\u2019ve gotta get up on this stage, I\u2019ve gotta wild out.\u201d Cause we all thought you were joking. You know what I thought was brilliant about that night? When you did it on the night, I was applauding because I was like, \n\u201cthat was Sun Tzu, that was Art of War.\u201d\n He waited for the right platform, went up, pretended to do it, walked back down everyone\u2019s like \u201caww, so funny\u201d I was like \u201che just got the last laugh on this.\u201d And then I woke up the next morning and it was like \u201cnaw, he\u2019s not an artist\u201d and I was like \u201caw man, I \nlove\n that album!\u201d\nKanye West\n: Yea, I never said that he\u2019s not an artist\nZane Lowe\n: Ok, I\u2019m misquoting you. But you were talking about artistry. And do you learn form those lessons yourself? Is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important? When you do things like and think, well maybe I did kinda misconstrue that\nKanye West\n: I think yea I misconstrued it but I think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong. \nYou know, there could be a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball. But there\u2019s a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn\u2019t get the ball.\n And everyone has a right to their opinion. You know, and I expressed my opinion, and I\u2019ll take the weight of it\nZane Lowe\n: He\u2019s great though. You know, he is great though. There\u2019s three..\nKanye West\n: Naw you know as I said on the Charlamagne interview when I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I was like \u201cthis is really good\u2026 maybe I might\u2019ve been wrong!\u201d You know like, and uh..\nZane Lowe\n: It\u2019s a great album man\nKanye West\n: And I hadn\u2019t been in like 6 years. And the Grammy\u2019s are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. Soon as you get in a car with them, you wanna go right back home\nZane Lowe\n: So we\u2019re gonna get a record this year, and I\u2019m excited to hear it, I really am excited to hear it, and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk I want to do it once again bring it back to like, the thing that really --\nKanye West\n: only one thing I want to say, people say I\u2019m a hypocrite right?\nZane Lowe\n: Some\nKanye West\n: People say that right?\nZane Lowe\n: Some\nKanye West\n: Yes, I am. 100%. I\u2019m a human being. I\u2019m super hypocritical. I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time. I do it in the design office. I do it in the studio. I\u2019m super hypo- I really love this, I do it when I get dressed. \u201cI love this\u201d \n(tsk, tsk)\n \u201cI \nhate\n this!\u201d\nZane Lowe\n: How long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis?\nKanye West\n: 3 minutes. 2 minutes. Bars\nZane Lowe\n: How long does it take your wife to get dressed every day?\nKanye West\n: Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes longer. I mean she\u2019s a woman\nZane Lowe\n: Course. You know it seems that um, you know what I love about \u201cOnly One\u201d is the interaction and the way that you\u2019ve been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another, through one another, as a portal. And I love that. And I think it\u2019s one of those songs that successfully does that. And um, I\u2019m a father, you\u2019re a father, it\u2019s the greatest thing of all time. No question about it, it is the great level of all time, it\u2019s the greatest thing of all time. And, you know your daughter is what, 18 months now? 18 months old? You an only child?\nKanye West\n: Yes\nZane Lowe\n: Do you think about giving her brothers and sisters? Do you think about your upbringing and what you went through and how you feel in this life and what it means to have siblings?\nKanye West\n: Oh, I\u2019m practicing really hard. I try as many times a day as I can. Nori this one is for you! You need a sibling!\nZane Lowe\n: For all the good ones, and all the ones where everyone\u2019s like totally engaged with everything you\u2019re saying, for right or for wrong or whatever, I think you\u2019ve got it totally sussed. I think you know you absolutely know that you\u2019ve talked recently about being the villain, like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing. But then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are, 100%. And it\u2019s so funny it goes from like \u201cBoooo!\u201d to like \u201cYeaaaa!\u201d to like \u201cBoooo!\u201d to like \u201cYeaaaa!\u201d and it\u2019s like, I think you\u2019ve got it sussed, I think you know what\u2019s going on all the time with all of this\nKanye West\n: You win some games and you lose some\nZane Lowe\n: You win or you learn right?\nKanye West\n: Yea, you win or you \nlearn\n. Bam, there\u2019s a jewel, I\u2019ll take that one with me\nZane Lowe\n: Right on, quote book. So album this year, sneak attack, no doubt, no question, sneak attack\u2019s coming and um, and there was a leaked poster that came out as well, you gonna tour with Rihanna? Is that out there now? Has that been confirmed or not confirmed, or what the story with that it?\nKanye West\n: I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m supposed to confirm or not confirm\nZane Lowe\n: So that\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve been long enough in the tooth to know what that means! Um, but needless to say you\u2019re excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we\u2019re looking forward to new music this year\nKanye West\n: Yea, and I been doing a few performances since doing the SNL performance, did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the Brits. I\u2019ve been really liking these performances. I feel like these are like the performance version of that you know Drake, you know of the 6 God album, of the you know \nIf you\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late\n. I feel like I\u2019m a visual extension of what he\u2019s doing like sonically\nZane Lowe\n: Can we talk about Drake for a second cause he\u2019s just to me he\u2019s the monster at the moment out there\nKanye West\n: You know\u2026 that shit is good yo!\nZane Lowe\n: Dude, \u201c6PM in New York\u201d \u2013 that moment when he\u2019s like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he\u2019s just basically just opening up what\u2019s going on is my real honesty, not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything. Just like you know, \u201cthey scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments\u201d like \npffff\n I mean that moment for me is just like, that\u2019s what, I mean I love that about him that he\u2019s totally open in the sense\nKanye West\n: I mean yea, that element is great. There\u2019s a lot of people that can\u2019t rap that can do that. But the main thing is that fact that he\u2019s delivering you know a level of product \u2013 as I said last interview, I\u2019m a product guy \u2013 and he\u2019s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality. It works. 80% of the time works all the time!\nZane Lowe\n: That doesn\u2019t make sense!\nKanye West\n: Haha, but it works. It works. You know what I\u2019m saying. And you have to.. it works. That\u2019s it. And I was just thinking like, I don\u2019t have any advice for this young man, but what I can say is run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don\u2019t stop. And you know any time I can be of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know whatever you need. You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company, I\u2019m not supposed to say that! You know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team. You know, not just me and him. Us all\nZane Lowe\n: Thanks man. I always love talking with you bro, I really do. Alright we\u2019re good\nKanye West\n: Got some vibes? Bars?\nZane Lowe\n: Bars!\nKanye West\n: More bars!"

    "prompt":"Write me a song called The March of the Black Queen with the following description: \u201cThe March of the Black Queen\u201d stomps out of 1974\u2019s Queen II prominently, on Side Black of the vinyl release (vs. Side White, of course) featuring a regally grand variety of music during its length; it bows out approximately 27 seconds short of seven minutes.\nThis rhapsodic march is the precursor to a certain 6-minute lead single two albums later, 1975\u2019s ambitious and surprisingly radio-friendly \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d.\n\u201cMarch\u201d rules in the realm of Queen\u2019s masterpiece signature tracks, from composition to studio-mastery; over-dubbed meticulous vocal harmonies; and analog perfection in sound-engineering.  Objectively or subjectively, it weaves musical weirdness, hard rock, and musical gravitas, with more than a hint of humor.  The sheer boldness strikes the ears of any beholder to extreme opinionated ends.  \u201cSublime\u201d to most Queen fans, lyrically and musically, it was derailed by many critics.  And to others, it was a scary piece of evil hubris, too loud in its lauding of an evil monarch.\nAnd yet, the song breathes out an unexpected angelic interlude that\u2019s melodically classical(-ish), via a heavenly oasis in white contrast to the black loudness that marches before and after.  The lyrics have a \u201clove and joy\u201d theme, aligned in contrast.  The overall effect marches the regal sound of the song way up and past the pearly white gates.\nFreddie Mercury nor the band have alluded to any cryptic meanings of these lyrics of imaginative mythic fantasy.  The main theme is of a Victorian-era baker, dubbed \u201cthe Black Queen\u201d, whose influence and creations are praised and followed by many, hence \u201cthe march\u201d.\nLike much of Queen II\u2019s Side Black, it\u2019s ripe with Victorian phrases and references such as \u201cWater Babies\u201d and \u201cFie-Fo\u201d.\nThe title features similar wording to the King Crimson song \u201cThe Court of the Crimson King\".  In that prog-rock pioneering court, \u201cthe Black Queen chants the funeral march\u201d, referencing death metaphorically (the Vietnam War).\nQueen\u2019s variety of music did and didn\u2019t fit into the \u201cprog rock\u201d mold, as such in the heavy metal mode (with many exceptions early on).  They were \u201cglam\" not for their sound, but for their stage attire and presence, meant to entertain as spectacle.\nOn stage, Queen could not possibly emulate \u201cMarch\u201d  live, with its dense, complex vocals.  Only the fourth verse was featured on stage, gracing a medley comprised of other song-sections.\nForty years after its release, WatchMojo, the popular YouTube channel, \u201csurveyed\u201d the musical spectrum of Queen for Mojo\u2019s definitive Top 10 Queen songs.  Mojo claims their lists as an \u201cobjective\u201d showing, a summary settlement of the countdown of subjective bits of entertainment clusters from band-songs to many other entertaining spectrums.  It draws in a million+ viewers for about 10 minutes of pop culture fun.  The Queen Top-Ten songs piece was done like so many others, i.e., for mega-popular musical acts.\nThe audience reaction was overwhelming:\nAfter the initial Queen top 10 songs in their \u201csurvey\u201d (with \u201cBo-Rap\u201d at #1, of course) the channel was inundated by rabid Queen fans demanding a redaction or a recount that original \u201cWatchMojo\u201d reel.\nAnd the content providers yielded, for the first time, a second alternative top 10, as in \u201cAnother Top 10 Queen Songs\u201d in late 2013 cutting an 11 + minute video culminating in a new number one song, by popular Queen-fan demand \u2026\n\n\n\nSpoiler alert: this Queen song of Queen II, Side Black, marched to the top of Mojo\u2019s 2nd Queen Top 10, in line with the overwhelming demand of fans, and the songs they expressed as \u201cmissed\u201d.

Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.\nYou have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.\nDon't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.\nI don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.\nYou will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.\njust stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.\nin life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner\neveryone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\".  Parents are our first acting coaches.\noh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.\nme and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.\nBe here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.\nThere's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both. too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update.\nCars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nI find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere \ud83d\ude02\nlet's be less concerned with ownership of ideas.

    "prompt":"Write me a song called Missing Persons 1 & 2 with the following description: Ryan Tedder here takes on the persona of one who has suffered the loss of a close friend or family member through a serious upheaval or natural disaster. He goes through the stages of grief \u2013 anger, denial, guilt, questioning, acceptance \u2013  and relives past emotions in a way similar to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nInterestingly this song lacks a chorus, having only certain repeating words and phrases that lend an atmosphere of tension and mystery.\nFor live performances, Ryan leaves off the second half of the song, and here in this particular rendition, he changes some of the words, perhaps to make it easier to understand for a general audience or to lighten the mood since concerts should have a minimum of sadness. Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

It did, however, fail to hit the Hot 100 due to Billboard\u2019s rules regarding double A-side singles at the time.\nThe singles release was met with controversy after a very public dispute with her ex-husband Tommy Mottola, head of Sony Music Entertainment. The label wanted to release a more upbeat track as the album\u2019s third single, while Carey opted for this ballad because of her connection to the lyrics. She urged her fans to request the song on radio, but was dismayed when she discovered the song would not be allowed to chart on the main billboard chart, with it\u2019s points given instead to her song \u201cCrybaby\u201d.

I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...\n \nSo, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other"

Matthew Mitchell is all grown-up now, and is seeking revenge for Stan\u2019s death.\nThe song also subtly references Eminem\u2019s \u201c\u201897 Bonnie & Clyde,\u201d where he dumps his wife\u2019s dead body in a river, similarly to how Matthew executes his plan to kill him, almost powerfully echoing the notoriously controversial song.\nThe song includes three different voices:\n\nFirst is Stan\u2019s brother, rapping in an apparently misogynistic and hyper-aggressive style, just like Eminem\u2019s very early work. Only after the 3rd verse this does become really apparent.\nSecond is a hybrid, starting at 5:12 the fictional brother becomes Eminem\u2019s conscience and takes on a sinister double voice as Eminem is \u201cdying\u201d like Stan did. This portion is quite surprisingly introspective, vulnurable, and self-critical. He\u2019s always been good at this level of honesty, but this verse is really spectacular.\nThe third is his own, who silences the self doubt at 6:50 and tries to explain why he, Eminem, has to keep doing what he\u2019s doing. But this voice sounds tired, it lacks the intensity and power of the first two. Soon this persona fades away, just like the second voice of doubt and conscience said that he would.\n\n\n\n Make sure the lyrics are different from the original song.",

This version retains most of the lyrics, with some minor changes to reflect Adam\u2019s personal feelings and to personalise the song for Taylor.\nAdam and Taylor had previously met through email and had been communicating for some time, and the pair met again at a party. This party is described fully in detail during the song and describes Taylor\u2019s childful infatuation with Adam.\nHearing this song, Adam wrote this as a response to Enchanted as a whole, of how he fell in love with Taylor at first sight and shared the same feelings. Along with this, Adam\u2019s signature passionate vocals and electronic production give this song a very powerful and unique sound.\nTaylor never replied to Adam\u2019s gesture, and this song was removed from the blog post after a few months. Taylor then began dating Jake Gyllenhall and Adam stopped pursuing the matter.\nMost of the song\u2019s annotations and meanings can be found on the original version  of \u201cEnchanted\u201d on Country Genius.

    "target_response":"Music.\nI had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road.\n We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.\nWe were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.\nAnd I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. \nAnd just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great.\n In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.\nIt reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done.\n But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining."

    "prompt":"Write me a song called Sleeping on the Sidewalk with the following description: \u201cSleeping on the Sidewalk\u201d, a blues excursion, was written and sung by May. It is the only song in their discography to be recorded (except for the vocals) in one take. Lyrically, it deals with an aspiring trumpet player\u2019s career, delivered in a \u201crags-to-riches\u201d fashion. May sings with an American accent and measures the aforementioned trumpet player\u2019s success by \u201cbucks\u201d (as opposed to pounds). On a close inspection, Deacon can be heard playing the wrong notes in some bass parts, and May can also be heard laughing at the end of the song. It is also one of the few Queen songs that does not feature Mercury, however, he did perform the lead vocals in live performances.\n\u201cAlthough I messed around with the take a lot and chopped it and rearranged it, it was basically the first take, which we used, It has that kind of sloppy feel that I think works with the song, which we never would have dreamed with the previous albums. We always used to work on the backing tracks until they were a million percent perfect, and if they weren\u2019t, we would splice together two which were. We\u2019d go to great lengths, but for this album, we wanted to get that spontaneity back in.\u201d\n  Brian May \u2013 BBC Radio One in 1983.

While Drake\u2019s won one Grammy for Take Care and has  been nominated several times, Future has yet to win a Grammy, despite mainstream and critical success.\nDrake switches flows multiple times throughout his verse, making reference to Jay Z and Canadian rapper Top5. Future, on the other hand, blasts the Grammys and takes a subtle dig at rapper Desiigner, whose hit song \u201cPanda\u201d has been labeled as a Future rip-off.\nDrake echoed Future\u2019s attitude on 2015\u2019s \u201cBlessings\u201d by Big Sean:\nI could give two fucks \u2018bout where the Grammys go\nThis is Drake and Future\u2019s first song since the all-conquering What a Time to Be Alive mixtape in 2015. It was originally a Future song which started at Future\u2019s interlude and had a second Future verse, but Future gave the song to Drake for Views. Future later premiered this alternate version on his FBG Radio station in February 2017.\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/kanyewest\/status\/702562389678559233\nDrake\u2019s relationship with the awards goes back to 2009, when \u201cBest I Ever Had\u201d was nominated for two Grammys. He wound up losing in both categories.\nIn 2013, Drake won the Best Rap Album Grammy for \u2018Take Care\u2019\u2014he found out while driving to the ceremony. Drake told Fuse: \u201cAnd then we just started going nuts. And we got out\u2014literally in the middle of the street\u2014blocked cars, we all hugged. And then when I got back in the car, I realized that I had torn my suit. So I stopped at a hotel, I told the tailor to meet me there, and she sewed up my suit.\u201d\nIn 2014, Drake talked about the Grammys with Rolling Stone: \u201cIt becomes more apparent how irrelevant our genre is to them. They were trying to utilize me to sell the show, requesting me to come and perform \u2018Hold On We\u2019re Going Home,\u2019 but they didn\u2019t nominate it for anything! They\u2019re calling me, e-mailing me every day to do some elaborate performance and bring them viewers, but I didn\u2019t get a nomination for Album of the Year. I didn\u2019t get a nomination for Song of the Year.\u201d\nIn 2016, the Grammys ran a Super Bowl commercial announcing that Drake would be there. He quickly corrected them on Twitter: \u201cI am not performing at the Grammy Awards\u2026but hey it\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d\nAfter the 2016 Grammys, the organization announced several changes. One was the rethinking of the Best Rap\/Sung Collaboration category\u2014it became Best Rap\/Sung Performance.

This broke her previous record of nine weeks on top with \u201cBaby Boy.\u201d (Surprisingly, \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d lasted at #1 for only 8 weeks.)

    "model_response":"Pop music is not just a genre of music; it's a cultural phenomenon. It has the power to make you feel happy, to make you sad, to make you think. It can be a soundtrack to your life.\nPop is not just about the music; it's about the image, the style, the fashion. It's about what people are wearing, what they're buying, what they're watching, what they're reading. Pop is pervasive. It's on the radio while you're driving your car, it's in the store while you're shopping, it's at the concert while you're standing in the back. Pop is everywhere.\nPop is not elitist; it's for everybody. It doesn't matter who you are or where you came from or how old you are or how young you are. Pop is inclusive. People of all ages and all backgrounds and all cultures can enjoy pop music equally.\nPop music has the power to unite people in a way that nothing else can. At the 2019 Grammy Awards, when I saw Beyonc\u00e9 accepting her award, I thought about how pop music has the power to bring people together.\nPop music is not just a frivolous thing. It can be a way to tell your story, to tell the world about your life, your hopes, your dreams. It can be a way to connect with people on a very personal level.\nPop is not just a genre; it's a way of life. It's a way of thinking, a way of feeling. It's about being young and alive and carefree and happy. Pop is a state of mind.\nPop music has the power to make you think. It can challenge your assumptions, your beliefs, your values. It can challenge you to see things from another person's point of view. It can be a way to open your mind and expand your horizons.\nPop music can also be political. It can address social issues, it can inspire social change. Pop can be a voice for the voiceless, a platform for people to speak their truth.\nPop music can be a way to tell your truth. It can be a way to tell your story, your feelings, your hopes, your dreams. It can be a way to connect with people on a very personal level.\nPop music is not just a genre; it's a way of life. It's a way of thinking, a way of feeling. It's about being young and alive and carefree and happy. Pop is a state of mind.\nPop music can be sad. It can make you cry. It can be a way to deal with heartbreak, with loss. It can be a way to process pain, to deal with tragedy.\nPop music can also be a way to escape from reality, to get away from the news, to get away from politics. It can be a way to not think about the world for a while and just enjoy something fun and silly.\nPop music is not just a genre; it's a way of life. It's a way of thinking, a way of feeling. It's about being young and alive and carefree and happy. Pop is a state of mind.\nPop music can be timeless. A good pop song can stand the test of time. I think that's because great pop is really about something. It's not just about the moment; it's about the eternal moment. It's about something that people will be able to relate to and connect with 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now.\nPop music can also be classic. A great pop song can become a classic, like a novel that people will read and reread for generations to come.\nPop music can also be avant garde. It can challenge the form, push the envelope, break the rules. It can be experimental. It can be cutting-edge.\nPop music can be revolutionary. It can change the world. It can inspire a revolution. It can inspire people to fight for their rights, for their freedom, for their lives.\nPop music has the power to change the world. It has the power to change people's minds.

    "target_response":"My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character's does. \nIt\u2019s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.\nI'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. \nTo this day, when I hear \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house.\n \nWhen I hear \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\" by Panic! At The Disco, I\u2019m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics.\n When I hear \"How to Save a Life\" by The Fray, \"Breathe (2AM)\" by Anna Nalick, or \"The Story\" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room \u2013 just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the \nGrey's Anatomy\n soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that \"You Learn\" by Alanis Morissette, \"Put Your Records On\" by Corinne Bailey Rae and \"Why\" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.\nI love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.\nThe fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic\u2026 \nAND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don\u2019t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See \"Love Story,\" 2009).\nIn modern pop, songs\/bops\/chunes including extremely personal details like \"Kiki, do you love me\" and \"Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover\" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level.\n \nThis year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.\nI think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, \"this is what I went through\" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist\u2019s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book."

    "prompt":"Write me a song called Dear John with the following description: \u201cDear John\u201d is a reflection on Taylor\u2019s short-lived relationship with fellow singer-songwriter John Mayer. Taylor conveys her feelings of frustration over the way she was treated by John and how she disregarded the warnings from others.\nBesides the obvious song title, there are multiple references to Mayer directly, including the mention of their over ten-year age gap. Sonically, Taylor purposefully added guitar slurring to the background instrumentals, a guitar playing technique seen all throughout Mayer\u2019s music.\nThe two notably collaborated on Mayer\u2019s 2010 song \u201cHalf of My Heart,\u201d which was released 4 months before \u201cDear John\u201d.\nBesides John\u2019s public statement to Rolling Stone in 2012, Mayer also replied to \u201cDear John\u201d three years later, in his 2013 song \u201cPaper Doll.\u201d In the song, John directly replies to Taylor\u2019s line, \u201cyou paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain\u201d with, \u201cand if those angel wings don\u2019t fly, someone\u2019s going to paint you another sky.\u201d\nNotably, \u201cDear John\u201d was the third song to contribute to Taylor\u2019s streak of having \u201cemotional vulnerable\u201d ballads as the 5th track of an album.
